## Overview

This app created in this project enables a user to get instant analysis of a WhatsApp Chat. The data used for this project does not include media files.

A user will simply get the whatsapp group chat txt file and upload it into the web app, and the app will display the overall analysis of the group.<br/><br/>

## Motivation

We often find ourselves joining or being added to numerous whatsapp chat groups and some time the number of unread chats can run up to hundreds or in some cases even more. This app can help a use to get the most relevant information(s) rather than manually skimming through a whole lot of chats.

## Problem Solving Steps

1. Collecting the data of a chat or group chat and saving the txt file in the project folder.
2. Preprocessing the text and extracting the important features.
3. Plot graphs showcasing the analysis
4. Integrating the analysis with the User Interface made using Streamlit. 
5. Deploy the application on Heroku cloud service

## Source of Dataset

The data for this project can be gotten from any whatsapp group chat. To get a whatsapp group chat data, follow the steps listed below;

* Move to the whatsapp chat group
* At the top right click on the `three vertical column`
* You will be presented with a drop down menu, click on `more`
* Select `export`

## Future scope of project

Much more analysis could be added for example; 
* Which user gets the most replies?
* Who is the most active user?

And many more...
