WHO DOES THE TOUGH JOB? IS IT YOUR VEHICLE OR YOUR BODY?

Late last year December/early January this year, l decided to service my car for enhanced performance at the following cost: 

A) Engine oil N4,500.00, 

B) Oil Filter N1,000.00,

C) Change of front wheel bearings: N25,000.00

D) Change the four tyres 205/60 Rim 16 @ 26,500.00: N106,000.00

E) Wheel Balancing & Alignment: N3,500.00

F) Servicing and Workmanship cost; N10,000.00

G) Bought Injector Cleaner & Chemical to minimize Fuel Consumption: N1,500.00

H) To cap it all l filled the fuel tank up with just N13,500.00
 
Total cost came down to N160,000.00!!!

While on my bed tonight, a thought began to creep into my mind after hearing so many sad news this year. 

Many colleagues/ friends from different fields died in their 40s, 50s, etc.

I was told that they complained of simple signs and symptoms of one ailments or the other And death struck....

I asked myself: 
HOW MUCH HAVE I SPENT THIS YEAR TO SERVICE MY BODY? 

For how long will you keep thinking all is well with your health in spite of all odds? 

We drive through dust at times, inhale all kind of unclean and highly polluted air, drink some water we don't know their sources, eat fast foods with additives and hazardous condiments.

We engage the computer and phone without minding our gradual exposure to radiations. 

If my car could gulp over  #160K in an instance just for fine tuning l think l deserve to diagnose and upgrade my system. 

Who is doing all the tough job, you or your car?

When last did you have a medical checkup?. 

How healthy is your lifestyle? 

What efforts are You making to maintain optimum capacity of your  body internal organs?

1) The Oil Filter is Kidney;
 
2) Fuel Pump is your Heart;

3) Air Filter is the Lungs;

4) The Plugs in your body is your Pancreas; 

5) Chemical Filters is your Liver; 

6) Your Chassis body is the Bones and skeletal system;

7) Your eyes are the head lamps; 

8) Your legs are the tyres;

9) Your veins and the intestine are the wires and the hoses.

Check your eyes, ears, vital organs like heart, liver, kidneys and lungs. It could make a difference.

Remember nothing is more important than our health. Health is Wealth!

NOTE: Don't be stingy...... So share with brothers and sisters around you.

I swear them no rate us at all😢
1/26/22, 3:05 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The subtle insult don too much

But na we follow cause am😀
1/26/22, 5:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: True
1/26/22, 2:44 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Still stuck in their old ways. PDP doesn’t seem ready to win the upcoming election. I mean, given the current political climate, why anyone would think that Atiku is a viable candidate is beyond me.
1/26/22, 2:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It's just pure arrogance and greed that makes them think whatever they give us we gobble up.

To be fair, they aren't exactly wrong but it's more than annoying to hear "Atiku one term". It's the equivalent of someone spitting in your face
1/26/22, 2:56 PM - +234 703 013 1067: Good luck Jonathan seek for one more term but they denied him, why this one? We're not fools ooo. The presidency must not come from the north.
1/26/22, 2:57 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Lol! Yes, unfortunately they aren’t wrong. And just like that, our elections will end up being a race between old and often clueless money bags. We repeat the same cycle every 4 years and somehow expect miracles to happen.
1/26/22, 3:04 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: I just wish everyone thinks like this. We should be able to choose leaders from anywhere. Buhari is from the north and yet today, the north is worst hit by insecurity, poverty and sectarian crises. The situation now is worse than it was during the successive administrations of non-northerners. 
My point is, it matters not where an individual comes from. If what he has to offer is good, then let us a nation, receive it. If it is bad on the other hand, let us wholeheartedly reject it.
1/26/22, 3:37 PM - +234 703 013 1067: True!
1/26/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 693 5215: True!
1/26/22, 3:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree with you on all points.
Sadly, not everyone voting has such mindset and not everyone is GEJ

No one that's a career politician will willingly do one term, particularly if they're failing
1/26/22, 3:50 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true

PRESS STATEMENT 

UPDATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF INTERCHANGE (FLY OVER) AT BRITISH AMERICA JUNCTION AND DUALIZATION FROM BRITISH AMERICA JUNCTION TO LAMINGO JUNCTION. 

The general public may recall that we recently issued a Press Statement on the above mentioned project.

In keeping to our promise to regularly give updates on the construction activities of the project, we therefore wish the general public to know that the surveys which included Geotechnical surveys, soil tests, load tests, etc. have been concluded and setting out/markings are being rounded up. The construction work proper is set to commence and the contractor requires full control of the construction site with little or no obstruction and/or interference from vehicular/human traffic in line with safety protocols.

It is in this light, that we are issuing this travel advisory for the general public to note. 

The British America junction will be closed to vehicular traffic beginning Sunday, 30th January, 2022 till further notice to enable the contractors set out for the construction please.

The road closure will be at the Plateau State Water Board water treatment plant for the Dogon Karfe Axis; At the Guaranty Trust Bank U-turn for the Murtala Mohammed Way axis; And at Film Corporation junction for Liberty Boulevard axis.

By this development therefore, motorists are advised to find alternative routes to their destinations some of which include the following:
1. Tudun Wada Ring road to Domkat Bali Road.
2. Secretariat junction through Plateau Hospital Road.
3. Plateau Hospital roundabout through D. B. Zang way.
4. Abbattoir-Dogon Karfe through Plateau State Dental Hospital Road.
5. Abbattoir-Dogon Karfe Roundabout through Hopehill Hospital to Ministry of Lands and Survey-ECWA Headquarters Road.
6. Rayfield to Lamingo Road.
7. Gold and Base through Shiaka to Liberty Boulevard Road.
The same will apply for those leaving Jos township to Bukuru and beyond.

The government regrets all inconveniences that will emerge as a result of this development and urges understanding and cooperation of the citizens. The Rescue Administration once more calls on all the good and peace-loving people of Plateau State to collaborate with the government to be able to achieve this noble project that has been highly anticipated.

ALWAYS THINK AND ACT PLATEAU.

Pam Bot-Mang, 
Honourable Commissioner of Works,
Plateau State.

2/10/22, 5:19 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’m not happy that a north central zone champ is looking like he managed to you know win Silver. This look does not match the write up of the prophet.

2/15/22, 4:13 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Wanted DCP Abba Kyari, 4 others now in our custody —NDLEA

Few hours after he was declared wanted by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA over his involvement in a 25 kilograms Cocaine deal, the Nigerian Police Force has handed over the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force, to the anti-narcotic agency.

Five of the wanted suspects namely: DCP Abba Kyari; ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu were driven into the National Headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja at about 5pm on Monday 14th February to formally hand them over for interrogation and further investigation.

The Agency wishes to assure that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that all suspects already in custody and those that may still be indicted in the course of investigation will face the full weight of the law at the end of the ongoing probe.

If money isn't an object ,then lithotripsy is better. Some stone may require more than one session of lithotripsy.

2/25/22, 8:45 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Thankfully our ubiaja youths  were able to block Ubiaja  Road by the rail line,, which forced the robbers to abandon their cash ladden vehicles off the rail line and flee in motorcycles. The vehicles and cash have been recovered and counting still ongoing at the Ubiaja police station. An arrest has also been made. God will reveal all the perpetrators.  The blood of the innocent Will hunt them down.
2/25/22, 9:00 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This simply addresses the reason why any stolen vehicle should be reported within 24hrs
2/25/22, 9:00 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: A lot of these vehicles would be stolen and if not reported. The owners would be first suspects
2/25/22, 9:01 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Indeed they were stolen vehicles
2/26/22, 9:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Universal truths remain constant despite the clamour for equality
2/26/22, 12:39 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Wow! This is complicated, and it means Russia has both the knife and the yam, and in any case, it's a win win for them. I feel for Ukraine because I don't see them winning this battle against Russia without dialogue and giving Russia full control of Eastern Ukraine. That means US, UK and other European countries will only sympathise with Ukraine, except US decides to use force and go to war with Russia, which will definitely be the beginning of WW3
2/26/22, 12:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true

US won't risk a full blown when the only other choice is Ukraine being sacrificed
2/26/22, 12:46 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Exactly. Even sacrificing the Eastern part alone will suffice
2/26/22, 12:47 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You guys make it look like sacrificing the eastern part will solve this. Maybe temporarily but Russia will keep at expanding its old soviet territories
2/26/22, 12:47 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Especially with Sweden and Poland now indicating interest in joining NATO seeing what Ukraine is going thru
2/26/22, 12:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yea
2/26/22, 12:48 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Russia does not want any American troops or Base near its borders whether in Ukraine or any other border country and it is justified
2/26/22, 12:48 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Back in the days when the Soviet and Cuba were Allies and they tried to set up a base in Cuba, America vehemently fought it
2/26/22, 12:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Now they want to serve a dish they couldn’t swallow themselves
2/26/22, 12:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree but for how long? Will they keep invading neighbors?

It looks a strategy that will fail in the long run
2/26/22, 12:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Truth is America has done it severally and got away with it and not even neighbors
2/26/22, 12:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: No difference in the two countries

They're both hypocrites just vying for power
2/26/22, 12:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Look at Iraq, Libya and Syria
2/26/22, 12:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They keep fighting proxy wars
2/26/22, 12:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They ran away from Afghanistan recently t
2/26/22, 12:50 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree and it's because of their status and influence on other countries
2/26/22, 12:51 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Russia was there first, US armed militia to fight off Russia. Then Osama and Taliban came and became a thorn in the US's side
2/26/22, 12:52 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Except Iraq and Libya, Russia has also been in those places Afghan, Syria

2/26/22, 6:25 PM - +234 806 965 1788: STATEMENT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE HONOURABLE CHAIRMAN OF THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC), PROFESSOR MAHMOOD YAKUBU, ON THE RELEASE OF THE TIMETABLE AND SCHEDULE OF ACTlVITIES FOR THE 2023 GENERAL ELECTION HELD AT THE CONFERENCE ROOM, INEC HEADQUARTERS, ABUJA, ON SATURDAY  26TH FEBRUARY 2022
 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press.
 
1.​  As you are aware, yesterday, Friday 25th February 2022, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria signed the Electoral Bill 2022 into law. This is historic being the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 that the Electoral Act was repealed and re-enacted. The 1998 - 1999 elections were administered by transitional decrees until the 2001 Electoral Act was passed into law. Then, the Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Electoral Act 2002 which was in turn repealed and re-enacted in 2006, 2010 and now we have the 2022 Electoral Act.
 
2.​  You may recall that in 2017, the Commission decided to establish fixed dates for General Elections in Nigeria. This decision was based on our determination to create certainty in the electoral calendar and to enable all stakeholders in the electoral process (the electoral commission, political parties and candidates, security agencies, observers, the media etc.) to prepare adequately for elections. By that decision, Presidential and National Assembly elections shall hold on the third Saturday of the month of February of each General Election year, while Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections shall follow two weeks later. Consequently, the 2023 General Election was scheduled to commence on 18th February 2023 with the Presidential and National Assembly elections, followed by the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections on the 4th of March 2023. However, the Commission could not release the detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election, as it normally would, because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Act 2022. The Bill has now been signed into law.
 
3.​  Therefore, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), form the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria. In particular, the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the General Election. One of the significant timelines is the publication of Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election which has now lapsed for the 2023 General Election.
 
4.​  Consequently, the Commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 General Election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law. Accordingly, the Presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday 25th February 2023 while the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday 11th March 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 General Election is now 363 days away.
 
5.​  Under the law, there are critical timebound activities from the publication of Notice of Election to the Conduct of Polls which form the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for elections. Some of the critical activities and their dates of implementation are as follows:
 
i. Publication of Notice of Election – Monday 28th February 2022.
 
ii. Conduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them – Monday 4th April 2022 to Friday 3rd June 2022.
 
iii. Submission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for Presidential and National Assembly election – 9.00am on Friday 10th June 2022 to 6.00pm on Friday 17th June 2022.
 
iv. Submission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for Governorship and State Assembly elections - 9.00am on Friday 1st July 2022 to 6.00pm on Friday 15th July 2022.
 
v. Commencement of Campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly election – Wednesday 28th September 2022.
 
vi. Commencement of Campaign by political parties for Governorship and State Assembly elections – Wednesday 12th October 2022.
 
vii. Last day of campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections – midnight on Thursday 23rd February 2023.
 
viii. Last day of campaign by political parties for Governorship and State Assembly elections – midnight on Thursday 9th March 2023.
 
6.​  The detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election will be circulated to the media at the end of this briefing. Soft copies will also be uploaded to the Commission’s website and social media platforms immediately. In addition, the Notice of Election will be published in our offices in all the States of the Federation as required by law on Monday 28th February 2022.
 
7.​  With the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, the Commission will work assiduously to conclude and publish new Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections that are consistent with the Act. These Regulations and Guidelines as well as Manuals issued by the Commission are all part of the legal regulatory framework for elections. Their timely publication will enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to become conversant with their provisions as they prepare for the 2023 General Election.
 
8.​  On this note, I wish to remind stakeholders, especially the political parties, of their responsibility to adhere strictly to the timelines in this Timetable and Schedule of Activities, as well as all other timelines established by the Commission. It is necessary that all political parties comply with the extant legal framework, ensure proper organisation and management of party primaries and the nomination of qualified candidates in order to prevent unnecessary litigations and rancour.
 
9.​  I thank you for attending this conference and God bless.

APC will zone the presidency to the southwest

3/6/22, 1:43 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Hmmm
3/6/22, 1:44 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Hehehehe

3/6/22, 1:45 PM - +234 817 034 1232: They are waiting for apc convention to decide their strategy

Lol
3/6/22, 1:47 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Isn't it obvious that Bola Tinubu has the ticket already?
3/6/22, 1:48 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Who wan challenge am for the primaries

3/6/22, 1:52 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Not true Sir
3/6/22, 1:54 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Well he can easily have the ticket if he wants 

But I think he will eventually hand it over to Osinbajo

Because if he takes the ticket. He is a Muslim from southwest. He needs a northern vice and if he picks another Muslim....Nigeria is too divided for a Muslim/Muslim ticket.

So he might step down for osinbajo. At least he has more control over him than Buhari.


On the other hand PDP cannot pick a Christian/Christian ticket...they will fail. So they would likely go for a Northern candidate/and a southern VP to grab power. Unless there is a serious threat to implode the party; they may zone it to Southeast. 
But this should be dependent on the apc convention if they have sense which they are clearly lacking
3/6/22, 1:54 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Those that determine our fate are not on social media. They don't reason much. They only follow instructions
3/6/22, 1:55 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

True to an extent
3/6/22, 1:57 PM - +234 806 921 7904: A good one for our democracy if he steps down for Osinbajo
3/6/22, 1:58 PM - +234 806 092 4290: That's true sha, but voting will take place
3/6/22, 2:02 PM - +234 806 921 7904: I think PDP will lose it if they zone theirs to Southeast or give the ticket to a Northerner
3/6/22, 2:03 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Sure, it isn't an appointment 😀
3/6/22, 2:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: If they give it to a northerner....it will be an outright win for them.

It becomes tricky if given to a southeast.

The winning still is dependent on the kind of VP they pick....even though they don't have influence after elections
3/6/22, 2:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol
3/6/22, 2:08 PM - +234 806 921 7904: The North will prefer Southwest to Southeast, while the middle belt down to the South will want a Northerner on the throne for another 8 years

3/6/22, 2:09 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Well, let's see how it plays out

Almost double. At the end of February 2022, just over a week ago, it was N415. Yesterday it was between N445 and N460. Today it is N579 per liter in Lagos, N599 in Abuja and N607 in Kano. And that’s where you find it. We have 5 flights on ground Abuja waiting for fuel from anywhere. They are not selling it except you pay cash up front.The aviation industry is likely to be grounded any moment now…

3/13/22, 10:48 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You really think it's ok for one sovereign nation to tell another what foreign policy to adopt?
3/13/22, 10:58 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You know your right stops where mine begins bah?

If people ( drug peddlers, pimps, arm dearlers) starting moving into your neighbourhood and start renting houses close to you...are you going to be comfortable?😀

We can as well say you shouldn't be bothered. They are adults who rented the building close to your place with their hard earned money and besides they have freedom of movement in their own country; so long as law enforcement has not convicted.

Off course you will complain or pack out.
3/13/22, 10:59 AM - +234 817 034 1232: That is what is happening with Russian neighbours trying to join NATO.

Putin will not be comfortable
3/13/22, 11:06 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's not a good analogy and you know it

Joining an organization like NATO isn't a crime and certainly doesn't warrant invasion as this post alludes

But I no even wan argue
3/13/22, 11:07 AM - +234 806 566 2895: So he kills people because he is uncomfortable?
3/13/22, 11:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: US and Cuba

3/13/22, 11:07 AM - +234 817 034 1232: I knew you would say it's not a good analogy

Your drug dealing neighbours moving into your estate is not a crime too

3/13/22, 11:09 AM - +234 817 034 1232: US was not comfortable with Russia moving to Cuba their neighbour


But they want Russia to be comfortable with they and NATO moving into Ukraine their neighbour
3/13/22, 11:09 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Even US knew it was a crime

They just coloured it and that's not the argument Bode

The real question is whether you can invade a country because of what they INTEND to do and kill civilians while at it?
3/13/22, 11:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Well they are all blue eyes bro. What is good for US is good for Russia
3/13/22, 11:10 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You don't want to argue because the analogy is spot on

What is good for the goose should be good for the gander

3/13/22, 11:15 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Thanks to China and Russia. Ethiopia won't stand today
3/13/22, 11:25 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I told you I don't stop if not the analogy is very flawed
3/13/22, 11:26 AM - +234 817 034 1232: There should be balance of power
3/13/22, 11:38 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Bode you still don't get

US is not the morality meter

US did it was wrong, Russia doing it can also be wrong

My point is this, it is wrong to invade a sovereign country, kill it's citizens because of INTENTIONS to join an organization which in itself isn't a crime

Debate that all you want but it feels like your neighbor coming to your house to beat you because you decide to be a Muslim and they fear you'll be a terrorist
3/13/22, 11:39 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I no get energy though. It also pointless but you should be able to evaluate each act for what it is
3/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I agree with you point. But you see, what is wrong no longer matter
3/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Ukraine and Russia have been at peace. Dialogue was done.
3/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 806 566 2895: This is the reason I've stopped debating you

At no point did I say the West was right. In fact I said US also did wrong but you drew your conclusion based your precognition of who you think I am

Ba wahala.
3/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But Ukraine think they want to be strong
3/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 806 566 2895: They never really were
3/13/22, 11:41 AM - +234 803 097 7516: There were

3/13/22, 11:41 AM - +234 803 097 7516: This guy is only trying to actualise his comedy

3/13/22, 11:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And called NATO and EU
3/13/22, 11:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You wanted to play a one sided narrative 

You are just recently condemning US to balance out the initial intent of casting Russia in a bad light
3/13/22, 11:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: That Ukraine wants to join
3/13/22, 11:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Touchè🤣

3/13/22, 11:48 AM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother

I've decided not to debate when we both can't evaluate an argument simply in terms of the argument.

If we have to start assuming a person's position based on who we think a person is, judging their intents especially when there's little evidence, then there's no point

Look at the argument and evaluate objectively. If you have to tag a person or label them, even wrongly, then I won't participate

See as I post this thing you argue simply without making it personal or labeling. That one I fit continue. Any other thing is simply exhausting
3/13/22, 11:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Chibu na case🤣🤣🤣
3/13/22, 11:51 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

You are preying on sentiments here

Won't work.

Disprove the neighbour analogy; so that  the case can rest.

This going around the debate Won't help
3/13/22, 11:51 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Hehehehe
3/13/22, 11:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother you win na

I no follow you argue

That one still no satisfy you?

3/13/22, 11:55 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You know the reason I posted this article was really simple

Russia is invading Ukraine. what if two or three other nations like Sweden, Finland decide to join NATO, does Russia invade them all? 😅

My point is that it's because it's one nation we are still arguing

Anyways food for thought

Happy Sunday

Chibu you can wank away on this😂
3/13/22, 11:56 AM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣wank
3/13/22, 12:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Interesting depositions from very intellectual men.
3/13/22, 12:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Sadly the concepts of “wrong” and “good” can no longer be discussed as black and white. In terms of international diplomacy and politicking today, it is best described as a spectrum. Everyone falls somewhere on that spectrum and justifies it with good reason too.
3/13/22, 12:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If the current crisis of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is to be dicusssed objectively, several apriori premises must be set forth and clearly understood.
3/13/22, 12:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In simple terms, The US as an empire has fought several proxy wars, this is simply one of it and Ukraine unfortunately is caught in the cross fire. A cross fire that has not seen one United States armed forces personnel raise a weapon.
3/13/22, 12:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Sweden and Finland certainly should thread with care. On the other hand Russia has not played its cards well. If an “enemy from across the Atlantic can assure your neighbors in Eastern Europe of more protection than you can and especially against you, then you have a problem.
3/13/22, 12:16 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 👌🏿
3/13/22, 12:17 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I don't think this is it. Ukraine is not looking for protection. They are looking for relevance and power
3/13/22, 12:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Russia has right to address any threat to its sovereignty and its people and if its neighbor feels safer aligning with someone miles away, that in itself is a decision. The repercussions are what we now see. 

The US has invaded numerous countries undeterred, its expansion into Eastern Europe is still strategy to keep Russia Subservient. Of cos it will not draw Russia into direct armed conflict.
3/13/22, 12:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I don’t know about Ukraine seeking relevance and Power tho. If that was the case, it shouldn’t seek membership of NATO. Ukraine continues to remain in an existential crisis particularly with Putin’s mad desire to re-establish the old Soviet empire as his legacy before departing. They have experienced the annexation of Crimea and same is happening with the Donbas region
3/13/22, 12:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It was only wise to find alliance to the west. We just seeing Game of Thrones playing out right before us
3/13/22, 12:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Don’t forget there is also a pseudo fight for resources here.
3/13/22, 12:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Ukraine as well as Russia largely accounts for much of the Elements used in producing semi conductors for military equipment
3/13/22, 12:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Great point

Peace is not peace except it's on Russian terms

That's why I tried to tell Bode they weren't at peace. Russia just had things their way for a while
3/13/22, 12:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Gbam!
3/13/22, 12:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I never said they were at peace actually. But there has been discussion
3/13/22, 12:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Russia trying to convince the again joining
3/13/22, 12:24 PM - Obekpa: I think the problem here is America,
They want to limit the growth of the Russian economy and military might. There would have been no way to initiate that along with their European Allies.
So they decided to decieve Ukraine with plenty of Military amunitions to provoke Russia.
If Putin would have thought wise maybe a prolonged negotiation or regional wars as already on going in Ukraine would have been enough to prevent NATO from accepting Ukraine because NATO policy is not to inherit any war when you re coming in as a new member.
Ukraine was used as a bait for Russia.
The war here is between America and Russia
3/13/22, 12:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Exactly. US want to use Ukraine
3/13/22, 12:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Ukraine is being foolish
3/13/22, 12:25 PM - Obekpa: Russia too
3/13/22, 12:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: America has Russia exactly where they want them to be
3/13/22, 12:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The fee was simply Ukraine
3/13/22, 12:25 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Well Russia would rather be foolish than bend to US
3/13/22, 12:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While America will not want to engage Russia in armed conflict, they have succeeded in bringing down never before seen sanctions that are akin to an economic war on Russia.
3/13/22, 12:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Countries like China and India as well as Pakistan who are also Nuclear powers understand this dynamics and have abstained.
3/13/22, 12:26 PM - Obekpa: No, they can create several civil wars in Ukraine and still achieve their aim with less harm to themselves
3/13/22, 12:26 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Bode see your comment na
3/13/22, 12:27 PM - Obekpa: They have never been at peace.
Russian separatist groups have been fighting in Ukraine for years now
3/13/22, 12:27 PM - +234 806 566 2895: There can be no winner
3/13/22, 12:27 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You seem to have something against it
3/13/22, 12:28 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Russian spreading groups but Ukrainian
3/13/22, 12:28 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Did you not see Poland’s Manuever
3/13/22, 12:28 PM - Obekpa: Them wise
3/13/22, 12:28 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Understanding that the US was also pitting them against Russia
3/13/22, 12:28 PM - +234 803 097 7516: With no form of judgement and justification, there is no way you can talk about the happening without calling the mess US is doing or has done
3/13/22, 12:28 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They offered to send the jets to US base in Germany so that US deliver it themselves
3/13/22, 12:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This exactly is my point
3/13/22, 12:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Ukraine needs to know that US is not their friend
3/13/22, 12:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: They best success they can have is to be at peace with Russia even when it is relative
3/13/22, 12:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Wisdom
3/13/22, 12:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The US is fighting too many proxy wars it cannot win externally and imploding internally with a lot of focus on non essentials like LGBTQ rights and the #Metoo movement
3/13/22, 12:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: These are simply signs of a collapsing empire
3/13/22, 12:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: US is their friend with benefit
3/13/22, 12:32 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Important points but it's difficult to say what the endpoints would be

People are slowly beginning to see the hypocrisy of US but other countries like Russia aren't helping their case by be the villain they were already painted as
3/13/22, 12:32 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣🤣🤣
3/13/22, 12:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Russia has always been the villain and has no intention of changing that. Rather they pulling other guys to join the bad gang like China and North Korea. That one is just waiting for someone to make mistake let him test his toys.
3/13/22, 12:34 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You are aware Missiles were fired yday from Iran territory into Erbil where the US consulate is in Iraq
3/13/22, 12:34 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Provocations everywhere
3/13/22, 12:34 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: How many wars can the US fight at once
3/13/22, 12:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: They done know this
3/13/22, 12:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The lesson tho for all countries is to seek self sustenance on all levels
3/13/22, 12:36 PM - Obekpa: They use proxies
3/13/22, 12:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: No doubt countries cannot have it all
3/13/22, 12:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Even the US today depends on Russian oil largely
3/13/22, 12:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And the proportion of Europe’s oil and gas needs supplied by Russia is 40% which is why they dragged feet for a while on oil and gas sanctions
3/13/22, 12:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And eventually because the US coarsed them oh
3/13/22, 12:38 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Biden is playing around his climate change policies by avoiding drilling for oil in the oil rich states of Texas and California. But between the last 3 days has signed massive numbers of permits for oil exploration firms
3/13/22, 12:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
3/13/22, 12:44 PM - Obekpa: The EU have refused to impose sanction on oil and gas until now.
It's only the US that has done that, the use only get 5% of its oil and gas from Russia
3/13/22, 1:01 PM - +234 817 034 1232: It's not really about Ukraine feeling safer with U.S that is far than Russia that is It's neighbour.

It is all about money

Money 💰runs the world.

U.S is the biggest economy in the world. While Russia is the 11th.

Naturally U.S will offer more juicy attractions to Ukraine.

Again in 2013/2014. The former president of Ukraine (Viktor Yanukovych) felt safer with Russia and aligned with them.

What did the U.S and NATO do? They orchestrated his removal

Even a serving U.S senator MCcain joined the citizens to protest.

They subsequent installed this current president Zelensky to their bidding and join NATO; thereby stiffling Russia.

So Putin has had enough
3/13/22, 1:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Again some nations align with the west to avoid sanctions 

Belarus that is aligned with Russia is under sanction

Naturally Ukraine would want to align with the west

It has nothing to do with Russia being a bad neighbour 

We know who the bad neighbour is
3/13/22, 1:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You posit that it is not about security but about money in your first few lines but I don’t see your subsequent submissions backing that position in the same breath
3/13/22, 1:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: U.S is the acclaimed number one both in military and economics

There is a reason they are not comfortable with Russia and China

Russia can match them military as number 2 and China can match them economically as number 2

So they are not comfortable with the rivalry
3/13/22, 1:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: For lack of time I will be constrained to start explaining 

But I post a link here 

But there are several others if you check

But will give an example below
3/13/22, 1:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/mar/19/facebook-posts/united-states-spent-5-billion-ukraine-anti-governm/
3/13/22, 1:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: When money change hands it can blur though process
3/13/22, 1:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Thought
3/13/22, 1:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Money changing hands is a fact, does it occur as an isolated incident in itself or there is a precursor. Do not forget that money in itself is a form of security. Need I go further? With this few points of mine Sir, I rest my case.
3/13/22, 1:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Time will fail me to relate the games in the Eastern European hemisphere to what has transpired in West Africa.
3/13/22, 1:12 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: For so many Years, Nigeria held sway as the big brother in ECOWAS predominantly funding Ecomog to as much as 80%
3/13/22, 1:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The US identified this and begins to drive the need for Democracy in Nigeria of cos the CIA and its guys get to work
3/13/22, 1:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They begin infusing money into our political space and sooner the polity is destabilized and EComog loses relevance gradually and Africomsat become big
3/13/22, 1:14 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Till today ECOMOG could not be revived. Re
3/13/22, 1:14 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Again remember the US made overtures to set up a base in Nigeria which the Nigerian Govt turned down
3/13/22, 1:14 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This was around the same time the BH crisis began and what did the US do? Setup a base in Niger republic from where they now operate in West Africa
3/13/22, 1:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Did they provide real-time intelligence to Nigeria on BH, I doubt as much.
3/13/22, 1:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The desire of the American empire to command security apparatuses all over the world is their undoing
3/13/22, 1:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: True
3/13/22, 1:28 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You know this👌🏼

3/13/22, 10:46 PM - +234 806 761 6952: @Rolly... your analysis and stands in this Ukraine - putins/ Russia war is quite commendable by any or all well meaning individuals who understand the rights of a people and a sovereign nation against tyranny or dictatorship. It's unfortunate that when it comes to making rational judgements about what is and what should be, many Nigerians can not see outside the box because the system has anaesthetised them to understanding tyranny,  suppression, dictatorship and authoritarianism as a way of life and so their judgements is muddled on a premise that is false, and their references to history about a not similar situation a speculation in cobwebs. 

What's the rationale behind making excuses for evil..! . This war in Ukraine is not about America! People have chosen to be blinded to the truths and rights of human existence when ever the word "America" comes into it. They just joggle points and concludes the situation is complex because their premise to reason is false, baised and deceiving.  If you know and appreciate good, you can never confuse it for evil. You only confuse good and evil when you don't have the right premise to know one. The war atrocity befallen the Ukrainians has nothing to do with America or Americans path in history. It's about an innocent people of Ukraine and the right for them to associate and purse their part to what the deem as freedom for themselves as a country. 

If you know about the Euromedian revolution in Ukraine in 2014 you will appreciate the desire of the Ukrainians to general develop by treading West. There is no country that does not seek to develop in this modern times and if your past associates can not afford you that, why hold you down.? 

Ukrainians gravitating towards the west is based on these principles. what's happening in Ukraine at the moment is a show of tyranny,  dictatorship  and limitation to the rights of human existence, and of sovereign country to forge its path to prosperity.
3/13/22, 11:56 PM - +234 806 761 6952: Why will the Nigerian government not turn it down ?  they know that in one way or the other the American influence will have a way of Stirling peoples right to a "needed" democratic hunger of which the cabals in Nigerian politics are afraid of.
3/14/22, 12:05 AM - +234 806 761 6952: Is it not a shame to claim giant of Africa, big brother in ECOWAS and want to depend on intelligence from a foreign country like America whereas Nigerian SSS and other security intelligence are penciled down on seeking intelligence on political opponents and regional successionists. Is that not appalling? Please let's give ourselves head and stop blame games.
3/14/22, 12:07 AM - +234 806 761 6952: Very false premise .

**The Nigerian MDGs Office/UNDP Best Governor in the Implementation of the MDGs in Nigeria*

*INTRODUCTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER MAJOR CHANGES IN NIGERIAN POLITICS*

*He was the first gubernatorial candidate in Nigeria to legally challenge to its logical conclusion, his governorship electoral victory that was denied him. He won in the Courts and reclaimed his mandate.*

*He was the first Governor in Nigeria to legally challenge his wrongful impeachment and was reinstated by the Courts.*

*He was the first Governor in Nigeria to seek the interpretation of tenures of Governors when INEC allowed elections to take place in Anambra State when his tenure had not expired; the election already concluded was cancelled and he was allowed to complete his tenure.*

*He was the first Governor to serve a 2nd term in both the new and old Anambra State, that is, almost 40 years after creation of the State.*

*He was the first Governor, whilst still in Office, to be appointed a Special Adviser to the President.*

*He was the first serving Governor to be appointed into the Presidential Economic Management Team.*

*He was among the first Governors to be honoured with a National Award in 2011, while still in office.*

*Though the only Governor whose political party was in government in only one State,  he was elected Vice-Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum twice.*

*Though the only non-PDP Governor in the South-East (made up of 5 States), he was elected by the other 4 PDP Governors as their Chairman for 8 years rather than the usual one year.*

*FUNDAMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF ANAMBRA STATE (PARTIAL LISTING)*

*1. Anambra was the first State to commence Sub-Sovereign Wealth savings, the first of its kind in Sub-Saharan Africa. At a time many other Governors were leaving huge debts, I left the equivalent of $500 million Dollars in investment as well as local and foreign currency, including $156 million in Dollar-denominated bonds.*

*2. For the first time in the history of Anambra State, Ambassadors and High Commissioners of notable countries such as United Stated, Britain, Russia, European Union, South Africa, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Canada, among others, visited the State. Before my tenure, Anambra was practically a pariah state blacklisted by the Diplomatic Corps and international development partners.*

*3. Development partners such as UNDP, UNICEF, the World Bank, DFID, the European Union etc., which hitherto were not in Anambra State started working with the State. Anambra was consistently adjudged one of the best states in development partnership and commitment to reforms for good governance.*

*4. He was recognised as Best Governor by the Millennium Development Goals Office (OSSAP-MDGs) and the UNDP in the implementation of their programmes in Nigeria.*

*5. The Nigerian Debt Management Office (DMO) rated Anambra as the least indebted state in Nigeria. In spite of visible and measurable achievements recorded in various sectors, the State under him did not borrow or raise bonds for her various projects.*

*6. The Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria rated Anambra State as the most financially stable state in the country.*

*7. The State's ground-breaking return of schools to their original owners - Voluntary Agencies (Churches) on 1st January 2009, and subsequent partnership with the Agencies in Education, saw the State move from 24th position out of 36 States to Number One in National Examination Council (NECO) and West African Examination Council (WAEC) examinations for three consecutive years. This made the World Bank to commission a study, led by the renowned Prof. Paul Collier of Oxford University, on this revolutionary partnership and phenomenal achievement.*

*8. The State also entered into strategic partnership with the Churches in the Health sector. This symbiotic relationship resulted in a tremendous boost to health care because of the services offered by health institutions owned by Voluntary Agencies, while the State restored grants to the agencies and made available to them more than 50 million Dollars in various types of support.*

*10. Through partnership with the Church in the Health sector, his Government funded the transformation of -:*

*a: Iyienu Hospital, Ogidi;*
*b: Our Lady of Lourdes *Hospital, Ihiala;*
*c: St Charles Borromeo Hospital, Onitsha;*
*d: Holy Rosary Hospital,* *Waterside, Onitsha; and*
*e: St. Joseph Hospital,* *Adazi-Nnukwu.*
*His Government also built the Joseph Nwilo Heart Centre in St. Joseph, Adazi-Nnukwu, where heart operations are now being performed.*

*11. His Government won the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (1 Million dollars) as the best-performing state in immunisation in the South-East. With complementary funding from our Government, they used the money to build 10 Maternal and Child Care Centres across the State, particularly in rural communities, in partnership with the Churches.*

*12. The State was the first to procure and distribute more than 30,000 computers to secondary schools, including 22,500 from HP. The Managing Director for Personal Systems Group HP Inc, Mr. FabriceCampoy described the deployment as the biggest  of such projects in the Middle-East and Africa.*

*13. Anambra State Government provided Microsoft Academies to more than 500 secondary schools, which the Head of Microsoft in Nigeria (Mr. Ken Span) described as the biggest such deployment in Africa so far.*

*14. The State provided Internet access to more than 500 secondary schools, which the CEO of Galaxy Backbone (Mr. Gerald Ilukwe) characterized as incomparable to any in the country.*

*15. More than 700 buses were provided to secondary schools in the State by our Government.*

*16. Boreholes were provided in schools all over the State.*

*17. Numerous classrooms were built in all the 177 communities of the State.*

*18 As part of the efforts to turn around the economy of the State, a number of companies were attracted to build their facilities in the Anambra State. A case in point is SABMiller, the 2nd largest brewery in the world, which built their first Green Field facility in the State, which is today one of the most successful facilities they operate globally.*

*19. A number of other companies followed the SABMiller initiative and were all supported and encouraged under our Government; a good example is INNOSON Motor Manufacturing Company, from which our government bought more than 1,000 vehicles.*

*20. Anambra State for the first time started close collaboration with recognized government security agencies (the Police, Army, Navy, Department of State Security, Civil Defence, among others), offering them various types of support including provision of more than 500 security vehicles. The improvement in security was phenomenal, such that the former IG of Police (Abubakar Mohammed) lauded Anambra State for not witnessing any bank robbery in my last three years in office.*

*21. To further enhance security, Anambra State provided at least one security vehicle to each of all the 177 communities in the State as well as various organizations such as markets and Churches.*

*22. His Administration conceived and built, from scratch, the first state-owned Teaching Hospital, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu teaching Hospital, Awka.*

*23. His Government commenced the planned development of the Igbariam Campus of the ChukwuemekaOdumegwu-Ojukwu University, including the fencing, construction of internal roads, electrification, construction of the Faculty of Law, Auditorium, Administrative Block, Faculty of Agriculture, Management Building, among others).*

*24. His Government attracted the World Bank support on erosion - National Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP) - to Anambra State.*

*25. His Government was the first to do Poverty Mapping in Nigeria, as a guide for the effective implementation of our poverty-alleviation strategies.*

*26 His Government, for the first time, undertook the aerial mapping of Awka as well as the production of Structure Plans for Awka Capital Territory, Onitsha and Nnewi.*

*27. During his tenure and with his Government's support, Anambra State became an oil producing State.*

*28. He built the first Secretariat Complex to house State Government Ministries that were hitherto scattered around the State.*

*29. His government commenced the development of the 'Three Arms Zone' comprising Government House/Governor’s Lodge, Legislative Building/Speakers Residence, and Judiciary Building with Chief Judge’s Residence.*

*30. By the end of his tenure in 2014, more than twelve (12) health institutions, including two hospitals, had secured accreditation; when we took off in 2006, no health institution in Anambra State was duly accredited.*

*31. Anambra State was the first to undergo national peer review, which scrutinised State Governments for good governance, through the State Peer Review Mechanism (SPRM), an initiative of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum in collaboration with the DFID.*

3/28/22, 9:48 AM - +234 806 092 4290: 😢😢😢This is sad. We pray for quick release
3/28/22, 9:49 AM - +234 806 537 0692: What is going on?
3/28/22, 9:50 AM - +234 806 092 4290: No where is safe in this country

3/28/22, 11:29 AM - +234 706 647 6470: UPDATE:

Progress on negotiation.

Latest demand is 5mil

I will update the house on further negotiation.

We may have to assist I guess
3/28/22, 11:31 AM - +234 706 098 3639: This is sad!
3/28/22, 11:51 AM - +234 806 537 0692: This is scary ooo
3/28/22, 11:51 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Sigh of relief. At least they are not hired assassins.
3/28/22, 11:54 AM - +234 806 092 4290: It's unfortunate we have to negotiate with criminals in exchange for life of our loved ones. Not something we want but "it is what it is". I suggest we raise something at our end to support the family, while they continue to negotiate for a lower fee
3/28/22, 11:54 AM - +234 806 939 9882: That's some progress
3/28/22, 11:55 AM - +234 806 939 9882: Let them reach a conclusion first.
3/28/22, 12:02 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I doubt if there's anything like conclusion in the minds of those criminals. They will only continue to stand their grounds till days pass by and they don't get what they want then they will make do with what the family can raise. Besides, we raising money from our end will not be automatic and may not be dependent on the amount "agreed". I am of the opinion we start making contributions and give whatever we raise at the time of critical demand
3/28/22, 12:14 PM - +234 803 755 0266: God show him mercy ... May he be released at no cost. By God's intervention. What God cannot do does not exist.
3/28/22, 12:14 PM - +234 803 755 0266: Happy birthday Noah... May your  celebration never cease
3/28/22, 12:20 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Happy birthday Noah
3/28/22, 12:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Really sad to hear. I hope he is released soonest
3/28/22, 12:42 PM - +234 803 693 5215: The Lord is our strength!
This is really sad!
Hmmmmmm!
3/28/22, 12:49 PM - +234 703 199 4953: Thanks Okopi for coming around and for the update. Thank you Titans. We will keep praying, this too shall pass. 
Good Lord, deliver us!
3/28/22, 12:50 PM - +234 703 199 4953: Happy birthday bro.
3/28/22, 1:44 PM - +234 803 970 5650: <Media omitted>
3/28/22, 1:45 PM - +234 803 970 5650: Thank God.

May he be released in one piece and at no cost in Jesus name
3/28/22, 1:45 PM - +234 803 970 5650: Happy birthday Noah
3/28/22, 1:53 PM - +234 806 158 7077: This is so sad. I pray for his safe release
3/28/22, 2:16 PM - +234 803 623 3688: Sad news indeed

We pray for his safe return

The Lord will continue to protect us
3/28/22, 2:29 PM - +234 818 989 5529: OMG!!! 

Praying for his safe release... Amen
3/28/22, 2:35 PM - +234 806 216 1419: This is sad.... We pray for his safe and quick release.
3/28/22, 2:51 PM - +234 708 436 8028: May God bring him back to his family safe and healthy in Jesus' name
3/28/22, 3:11 PM - +234 806 529 3872: Amen
3/28/22, 3:22 PM - +234 803 470 6347: Happy birthday Dr Noah
3/28/22, 3:50 PM - +234 703 505 6225: This is indeed very sad
3/28/22, 3:51 PM - +234 703 505 6225: We are praying for his safe return
3/28/22, 4:09 PM - +234 703 199 4953: Good day all. Pls let's refrain from picking any call coming from Slosh/Dr Solomon Chollom (07039634888), they're are just calling people at random using his line complicating and diffusing the negotiation front. Thank you.
3/28/22, 4:25 PM - +234 803 458 6288: This is really sad!  We pray for his safe return and unhurt... It's well.
3/28/22, 4:28 PM - +234 817 271 4735: This is sad news
3/28/22, 4:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Not sure it is completely a wise idea
3/28/22, 4:29 PM - +44 7459 768544: Really sad 

God will bring you back safely
3/28/22, 4:32 PM - +234 703 199 4953: Any ideas are welcome sir, u can DM me on that. Thanks
3/28/22, 4:33 PM - +234 706 656 2719: May be from security point of view
3/28/22, 4:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You never try to frustrate a kidnapper or resist anything
3/28/22, 4:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: That's the first rule
3/28/22, 4:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Rather communicate the current negotiate status and cost to all possible contact
3/28/22, 4:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And let the word be same
3/28/22, 4:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Remain flexible with them
3/28/22, 4:39 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Just listen and refer them to the family
3/28/22, 4:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It was Bode

Let's not allow them extort several persons with seemingly unlimited income

Let them dialogue with one person and then we can contribute

If they get wind of us, the money will exponentially increase
3/28/22, 4:39 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And say you will make effort to reach the family too
3/28/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Actually that wasn't my point
3/28/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: My point is not picking is detrimental guys
3/28/22, 4:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: They have already probably contacted the family

Let's not feed their greed
3/28/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I have seen this before
3/28/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Just form helpful and refer too family
3/28/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't engage in negotiations as you are not family member
3/28/22, 4:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ok but I don't think we should pick

They have already established lines of dialogue

Any other attempt should be avoided
3/28/22, 4:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You are not feeding greed you are protecting the victim
3/28/22, 4:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That's harder to do when you've begun conversing
3/28/22, 4:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Then let everyone let them know that's remains the channel
3/28/22, 4:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But not picking is detrimental
3/28/22, 4:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: I agree with Bode ooo

Don't aggravate kidnappers
3/28/22, 4:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: They'll bill the family and you

Once family pays they will await you're and that endangers him further
3/28/22, 4:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yours*
3/28/22, 4:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Well with this information I think people are more aware not to negotiate
3/28/22, 4:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Simply refer them to the family
3/28/22, 4:43 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

The call should be picked
3/28/22, 4:43 PM - +234 803 097 7516: People you are dealing with are all on substance often time
3/28/22, 4:43 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You don't want to get them frustrated
3/28/22, 4:44 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Refer them to family. This is my own opinion sha o. From security training and a hijacked collegue. But then subject to individual view and opinion
3/28/22, 4:44 PM - +234 813 664 9569: I agree with bode, I have dealt with them directly, you have to pet them and follow them gradually. Anything that will aggravate them is to be avoided
3/28/22, 4:45 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This is only if you negotiate
3/28/22, 4:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba once you pick that call you have little to no control
3/28/22, 4:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Toh
3/28/22, 4:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This is because the person listening wants to talk and reply
3/28/22, 4:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This is a call that only requires two response
3/28/22, 4:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: First hello who is this. After narrative ok I will contact his family
3/28/22, 4:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Our different advices are a result of our experiences. 

To each his own
3/28/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Emma come and remind us ssafe training you are the one in MOG now may be my learning is expired
3/28/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I agree totally
3/28/22, 4:50 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And that's why I said it is subject to who is called to make a decision
3/28/22, 4:50 PM - +234 803 097 7516: If you think you will talk too much
3/28/22, 4:50 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't pick
3/28/22, 4:50 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Well they will use another number  next day
3/28/22, 4:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: At that time you are caught unguarded not knowing it's them
3/28/22, 4:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Then you run into trouble you are avoiding
3/28/22, 4:51 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I agree with you. Just pick and tell them that the family will reach out to them. You can even pretend not to be aware of the kidnap. Plead with them not to hurt him. Disclaim being a family member and promise to try to inform his family.
3/28/22, 4:51 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I have a personal experience

After collecting from the family, they started billing friends and refused to release my friend. Once that communication begins, you're hooked, except you don't care
3/28/22, 4:51 PM - +234 703 199 4953: Thanks house for the inputs, not everyone knows to refer to the family.  
I am not the negotiator by the way and sure, no 1 wants to anger a kidnapper, not at all
We all need wisdom.
3/28/22, 4:52 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 👌🏿
3/28/22, 4:54 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I understand, but not everyone in his contact even knows that he has been kidnapped.
3/28/22, 6:06 PM - +234 803 614 5338: Kai. Me, I'm tired of this terrible people. May God protect him.
3/28/22, 6:17 PM - +234 803 513 3391: Ameen.
3/28/22, 8:31 PM - +234 806 547 0772: AMEN, may he come back safe and sound. It's well oh
3/28/22, 8:33 PM - +234 806 547 0772: I sincerely appreciate and say AMEN to your prayers on my birthday. May God honour you too, God bless you All
3/28/22, 8:36 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Happy birthday Noah.

4/4/22, 10:12 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I’m leading Yahaya Bello’s campaign because he has same qualities as my father: Hafsat Abiola.

The DG expressed the confidence that Mr Bello would clinch the ticket of the All Progressives Congress irrespective of the zone of the National Chairman.

Hafsat Abiola, Director-General, Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, says she is leading the campaign efforts of the Kogi governor because she sees  the qualities needed to take Nigeria to its right destination in him.

Ms Abiola, daughter of late Chief M.K.O Abiola,  acclaimed winner of the 1993 presidential elections, said on Sunday in Lagos that one of the similarities between her late philanthropist father and the Kogi governor, was that they both refused to have political godfathers.

This, she said, was responsible for the persecution the governor had faced by different interests and the controversies around his administration.
 
The DG expressed the confidence that Mr Bello would clinch the ticket of the All Progressives Congress irrespective of the zone of the National Chairman.

“Nigerians must be given the free hand to choose their leaders. That is the meaning of democracy. My father did not contest to represent zoning interests. His interest was Nigeria and Nigeria alone,” she said.

She added that another similarity was that the late MKO believed in a United Nigeria, just like Mr Bello, noting that he also treated everyone around him with respect regardless of their social standing.

“These are the same qualities I have seen in the Kogi governor. He dared to contest, not minding that he was from a minority tribe in Kogi and won, and he has come out again. My father did the same, when it was believed that a Yoruba man could not be President.

“Yahaya Bello is the best man for the job. And you know me, I’m not driven by pecuniary considerations. I do what I believe in. In the next seven weeks, we will be working hard, and when we emerge, we will deliver a Nigeria of our dreams,” she  said.

She said her father would have been happy to see that a young, courageous man like Mr Bello had done everything to bring back his Hope ’93 in Hope ’23, with the same person that did the manifesto on board – Sen.  Jonathan Zwingina.

Many Nigerians from all walks of life had stormed the Eagle Square at the nation’s capital on Saturday to witness the official acceptance of Mr Bello to vie for the 2023 Presidency.

While declaring his intention to run, Mr Bello reiterated that he had demonstrated capacity to lead Nigeria in his present assignment as the governor of Kogi, noting that, for him, all that mattered was Nigeria and the wellbeing of citizens.

Ms Abiola pointed out that the presidential aspirant had the right marks where the votes were – women and youths – adding that being the first female Director-General of a presidential campaign organisation was an attestation to Mr Bello’s unrivalled record in women inclusion.

4/4/22, 10:19 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The political class is completely disconnected from reality and swim regally in a pool of delusions.  Consequently, the focus is on aggregating as much as they can before the “Zoo” implodes.  They have succeeded in eliminating the middle class which could have possibly put up a fight for some semblance of order in governance. What is left is the almost 50% of Nigerians living below poverty line grasping for straws and ready to turn towards whoever provides succor per time.

Nigeria is hemorrhaging.

The likes of Osinbajo, Peter Obi will only come to apply a bandage to a bleeding festering wound.

While the likes of Yahaya Bello, Rochas, Orji Uzor Kalu, El rufai will go for total amputation.

Which is what the country needs right now😃

4/5/22, 8:25 AM - Paul Ashir: And her sister.
4/5/22, 8:27 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Her sister was milder oh.
4/5/22, 8:27 AM - Paul Ashir: Milder or soft spoken.
4/5/22, 8:27 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Both
4/5/22, 8:28 AM - Paul Ashir: They were a bad combo in scbu that year.
4/5/22, 8:29 AM - +234 806 965 1788: 🤣🤣🤣
4/5/22, 8:30 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Her sister was alot milder.
4/5/22, 8:30 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Well more of soft spoken. But Ige Kai ......
4/5/22, 8:33 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Ige was something else gaskiya
4/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 803 097 7516: They bahaved as if to be doctor or consultant hard pass to pass through eye of needle
4/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Behaved*
4/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 806 965 1788: But I learnt that those toxic Paedo consultants in JUTH are calmer now unlike before
4/5/22, 8:36 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I hope they no longer do that lol. Cos the world is leaving the toxic, bossy system behind. With such behaviour, now you are tagged as zero social and emotional intelligence
4/5/22, 8:36 AM - +234 817 271 4735: Ige was a beautiful, hardworking and cheerful person who loved her students unconditionally. She so much loved her job to the point of appearing as if she was mean. Her chest x-ray showed a good heart that is very soft hidden behind a hard face
4/5/22, 8:37 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Welldone storyteller
4/5/22, 8:38 AM - +234 817 271 4735: C'mon Bode, you knew how she was praying for you
4/5/22, 8:38 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Well unfortunately I can't even remember some faces now . They need to introduce themselves to be remembered ☺️
4/5/22, 8:38 AM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4/5/22, 8:39 AM - +234 817 271 4735: 😀😀😀😀
4/5/22, 8:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I am poor at keeping memory of bullies. I'm sorry
4/5/22, 8:40 AM - +234 817 271 4735: I'm sure she's still praying for you. Her face will appear to you on your way to Damascus
4/5/22, 8:40 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Dr Mrs Idoko, Dr Ige's sister was nothing compared to Dr Ige
4/5/22, 8:40 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Infact, Dr Ige gets angry with her seeing her relate with students nicely
4/5/22, 8:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I effortlessly would remember Silas, dakum, Sule and their few likes.
4/5/22, 8:41 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I hope she is a professor now
4/5/22, 8:43 AM - +234 806 537 0692: She is a very nice person (Dr Ige) but got the wrong impression that she needed to be mean to get across to her students ...

I personally had a very great time with both sisters, with zero harrassing ... But I saw Ige destroy the self esteem of some people especially ladies ... It was never nice ...


I believe she is calm now, she is already a Professor
4/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: With all that their wahala na still SHO or registrar many of them go start from outside that JUTH when dumped in a 'saner' system🤣🤣. 🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️. Las las all of us don dey alright now abi. As some of us can't be consultant now , some of Una don be for us and equal grounds are finally attained. Na where old fowl Siddon , new chicken go grow meet am if the fowl no die early.
4/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Not impression. She is INTELLECTUALLY great but socially and emotionally zero
4/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Such don't make great tutors or leaders
4/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: She shouldn't be a teacher
4/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: So if your teacher is there destroying who you are and fail to understand that learning curves are different
4/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: How are they helping to coach you
4/5/22, 8:46 AM - +234 806 537 0692: My brother ... Ige vex say student make new hair after weekend and she no get chance make her own hair ....

She got angry with a lady cos she saw her dress nicely before putting her wardcoat and made reference to dressing nice being all she knows
4/5/22, 8:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Many of us probably had dyslexia
4/5/22, 8:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I know a Friend in our class who had that. Then you fail to understand that as a clinician and a teacher
4/5/22, 8:48 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Mehn .... That woman changed group rep because she felt the person's make-up was too much ... And had to look for the person with no make-up to be group rep
4/5/22, 8:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Low minded little mind thing 🤦🏿‍♂️
4/5/22, 8:49 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol🤣🤣
4/5/22, 8:49 AM - +234 803 097 7516: We couldn't say anything cos we were in a system that doesn't see it wrong to bully people outrightly
4/5/22, 8:49 AM - +234 806 939 9882: I think she amond all the SR/new consultants then , I would classify her as worst than others. Also petty with side talks
4/5/22, 8:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But I think there should be some post-graduation feedback mechanism to tutors
4/5/22, 8:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: To have a quality improvement process
4/5/22, 8:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: No one has to bully anyone to impact knowledge
4/5/22, 8:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: How are they different from Will Smith of slapology
4/5/22, 8:51 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Yes because the younger ones now no dey take the shit we took.
4/5/22, 8:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I concur
4/5/22, 8:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Next thing they will see themselves on social media
4/5/22, 8:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Those ones will damage them and move to private university
4/5/22, 8:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Or even Ghana
4/5/22, 8:52 AM - +234 703 656 1230: <Media omitted>
4/5/22, 8:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Well I never had an identity that was clear in pediatrics actually🤣🤣
4/5/22, 8:52 AM - +234 806 965 1788: 😂 Omoh.
4/5/22, 8:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: They couldn't define whether I was serious or not
4/5/22, 8:53 AM - +234 806 939 9882: Shege radiologist
4/5/22, 8:53 AM - +44 7774 787647: I don't know what kind of brain i have i can't even remember all these people. I can't remember the name talk more of how they look

4/5/22, 8:54 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Ige destroyed my self esteem in paediatric posting Kai.......
4/5/22, 8:54 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And couldn't realise her own beauty at young age
4/5/22, 8:54 AM - +234 803 097 7516: To amplify it
4/5/22, 8:54 AM - +234 803 097 7516: As if it is anyone's fault
4/5/22, 8:55 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Wemi, how you take forget Ige that harrassed our group alot 

We had a group that consisted 6 females and 2 males, so the group suffered in Ige's hand cos of the many ladies
4/5/22, 8:56 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Haven't you seen what is called conscious and intentional selective amnesia

4/5/22, 8:57 AM - +234 703 656 1230: She had some unresolved demons honestly. Was she in a good place with her hubby then? Cos It seems like she was pouring her anger on students for unresolved issues from home
4/5/22, 8:58 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Well don't rule that out with also possiblity of secondary frigidity

4/5/22, 9:00 AM - +234 817 271 4735: I wasn't the one who read the film

4/5/22, 9:02 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Such a pretty woman with a nasty attitude. It was so sad. Even if I got her question right she would say something so insulting to me. She once called me dunce in SCBU.  Then proceeded to ask me something which I clearly knew the answer but I just told her I don't know....... I was so angry that day. She just hated me for no reason
4/5/22, 9:02 AM - +234 806 537 0692: One day he dared to ask me what students think of him ... Other people around refused talk .... I opened chapter for the man and he was shocked 


He claimed surprised to hear how bad students think of him, he was touched
4/5/22, 9:02 AM - +44 7774 787647: By asking first who are you by the way? What did you say your name was? 😊

4/5/22, 9:09 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Wasn't it obvious. She wasn't getting a great diluting hormonal therapy
4/5/22, 9:09 AM - +234 806 537 0692: How was she your Paddy?

But I use to give feedback immediately
4/5/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Till date we still talk. And still reach out. Na easy babe sincerely. Many don't know her soft spot. She had inferiority complex issue
4/5/22, 9:10 AM - +234 806 537 0692: She became very nasty ooo

4/5/22, 9:11 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Obviously the complex worsened with inability to meet societal and cultural expectations
4/5/22, 9:12 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Babe u much remember Ige oh. Pretty face, long hair always packing her hair. Her sister was in O&G that had a little boy born with congenital heart deformity.

4/5/22, 9:13 AM - +234 806 092 4290: That was always my assertion too. She was never friendly to me and most people I know way back in JUTH
4/5/22, 9:13 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Her sister was in Paedo but married to the then O&G Chief Resident(another not so nice dude ... Dr Idoko)

They eventually moved abroad.
4/5/22, 9:14 AM - +234 817 034 1232: No mind Omale

4/5/22, 9:15 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Did house Job under Halim in Dalhatu Araf. Halim was so impressed with my work being the only HO in paediatric unit them so much so that When I was leaving he insisted I do residency in paediatric, I told him of how their examiners were sadist and wanted to be like his friend Dr Femi who was working with IHVN then collecting big money.

4/5/22, 9:16 AM - +44 7774 787647: Most times the cause of all this is hormonal, could be they were menopausal.  HRT would probably help.
4/5/22, 9:17 AM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣🤣🤣.  May also be attitude induced partner or spousal abandonment
4/5/22, 9:17 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Which also lead to declined hormonal dilution
4/5/22, 9:17 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Which the escalate
4/5/22, 9:18 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Theres this other lady too a paediatrician who wears glasses. She wasn't passing her exams and was pouring the anger on us during rounds. At some point we started praying for her to marry

4/5/22, 9:20 AM - +234 703 656 1230: I remember her very well. She was close friends with that Yoruba Dr that did a lot of tutorials for us. Av also forgotten his name.

4/5/22, 9:24 AM - +234 703 656 1230: U know Wemi ba u can just finish saying something to her now and Wemi will turn and ask another "what's she talking about and just walk away in her I don't care mode" that's why Wemi won't remember her cos she didn't take anything Ige did to her to heart
4/5/22, 9:24 AM - +234 806 939 9882: What about female Dr Aliyu the tall lady married to Dr Mohamed. That one was toxic too

4/5/22, 9:27 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Mehn .... We need Alice's story with Ige ... The women made people shed tears
4/5/22, 9:28 AM - +234 806 537 0692: She was toxic but on the queit side, no too much unnecessary insults and bullying
4/5/22, 9:29 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Ige , one day she told me all the pastors in our class are END TIME PASTORS.

4/5/22, 9:34 AM - +234 806 939 9882: There was this guy in infectious dx unit, internal medicine under prof idoko. He appeared calm but will insult your life till you will forget all the stuff he taught.  I have forgotten his name.
4/5/22, 9:35 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Sincerely, things have changed ... I have heard students and young resident talk about our mates in the same JUTH and I have had to proudly say 'That was my classmate'
4/5/22, 9:35 AM - +234 806 965 1788: That one was a sadist 😀😀😀
4/5/22, 9:35 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Ejiro and I just in February saw Yiltok in an eatery where we also went to eat.  See the way we were greeting him with smiles even bowing our knees out of respect, only for us to be shawned. The embarrassment was just too much.
4/5/22, 9:35 AM - +234 806 939 9882: There will always be those teachers students dread and those they pally with. That is life my dear

4/5/22, 9:37 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Chief, dreading a teacher cos he is tough and principled is different from being scared cos they person will insults you and destroys your self-esteem mostly over not so serious stuff
4/5/22, 9:37 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Dr Essien?
4/5/22, 9:37 AM - +234 806 939 9882: Yes. That is him. With him belle like my own
4/5/22, 9:38 AM - +234 703 656 1230: It's wasn't about recognition because obviously we were going to say "we are your ex medical students"

It was more like not even behaving like we were talking to him
4/5/22, 9:38 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lolz

4/5/22, 9:40 AM - +234 806 965 1788: He was under infectious disease during our medicine posting M3
4/5/22, 9:40 AM - +234 703 656 1230: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4/5/22, 9:41 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Most of us that did Housejob in FMC Makurdi met our chiefs who were once harsh to us as students, but had a nice relationship with us as Doctors ... Being reminded of those days, they mostly said 'we are all doctors now'
4/5/22, 9:41 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Kai Chibuzo u no well oh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
4/5/22, 9:41 AM - +234 806 965 1788: 🤣🤣🤣🤣

4/5/22, 9:41 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Oh ok. Av always known him to be under derma

The guy made me hate clinical posting ... He had to categorically tell me he picks on me cos I reminded him of NCCMDS which he hated and I was close to Dr Agaba
4/5/22, 9:45 AM - +234 806 537 0692: The guy code names me NCCMDS during ward rounds
4/5/22, 9:45 AM - +234 806 537 0692: It turns out he was Dr Agaba's mate but was unfortunately still his SR at the time
4/5/22, 9:46 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Dr about Dr Elachi, he embarrassed me one day during House Job for addressing as Chief instead of Sir. He blasted me that  wasn't his mate to call address him as chief. That was the day I came to know that the difference between addressing a Dr as "chief" and "Sir". He practically insulted me and from that day I avoided him
4/5/22, 9:46 AM - +234 703 656 1230: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

4/5/22, 9:57 AM - +44 7774 787647: Pls lets remember there is a difference between being born again Christian and people's innate behaviour. Let's keep praying for ourselves its not easy to change completely.

Why person go dey wicked just like that?
4/5/22, 9:58 AM - +234 803 310 4903: This is the summary of the matter for me. Any of our classmates that knows that he/she has these tendencies should just know that the swear that students will swear for you must catch you.

4/5/22, 10:10 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Sincerely, we need to do better in Medicine ... 

Bullying, insulting, demeaning a person is not a way of teaching ...

You can be firm, strict and principled as a teacher ... Without being wicked.

We all remember some of those teachers who were very strict with us but we look back and appreciate their principles ....

Let's draw a clear line between being plain wicked and sadistic from being strict and principled
4/5/22, 10:27 AM - +234 803 052 3166: My group called him Mrs Idoko. He was constantly nagging while the wife in paeds was the reverse.
4/5/22, 10:28 AM - +234 806 537 0692: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

4/5/22, 10:36 AM - +234 803 052 3166: It's a case of being small minded. Mostly you will discover the interest in this individual mainly stems from the fact that he/ she is actually better. Poking /hurting the person makes them feel better.
4/5/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Description of sign number 5 🤣

4/5/22, 12:12 PM - Paul Ashir: We had UJ/91 in our class.
4/5/22, 12:14 PM - Paul Ashir: Quite unfortunate.
4/5/22, 12:32 PM - +234 806 537 0692: As a student, we saw this guy differently ... Only to meet in Makurdi and had a good time working together... Like Med school never happened
4/5/22, 12:34 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Some people are just funny ....

I met Prof Okeke last year at a WACP conference and went to greet her ... It was a very pleasant encounter with her 

Same way I met Prof Ocheke (Paedo) last year during MDCN foreign trained lisensing exam and he was so happy to meet his student
4/5/22, 12:57 PM - +234 806 954 1554: Yes we called him Aunty
4/5/22, 1:01 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂
4/5/22, 1:04 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

I can't imagine as an SR harassing and belittling students. They are so far beneath you, they're nearly boring. People just dey start life, you dey manhandle them

Teach them and move on

I saw Andeyaba, private sector don calm am down but tendency still dey😪
4/5/22, 1:06 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣@andeyaba but he is still in public sector
4/5/22, 1:06 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Just that out there in non clinical field you relevance is low
4/5/22, 1:06 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Cos a bsc holder can even do what you are doing better
4/5/22, 1:06 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And has more skill than you
4/5/22, 1:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You must calm down
4/5/22, 1:07 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

You'll learn to behave when you see persons wey be your oga dey respect you
4/5/22, 1:08 PM - +234 803 755 0266: I know right!
4/5/22, 1:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yeah

Their generation just adopted toxic character handed down to them without questions

It's good people realize there are other ways to motivate learning

4/5/22, 3:00 PM - +234 703 505 6225: My man Nimkur.
How I made him happy during House Job is still a mystery to me.
First day I resumed he called me to his office  and said "I have promoted you to the SR position today go pack your clothes from your house and move to the call room".
I was the HO, Reg and SR working with 3 consultants that don't see eye to eye😃😃😃
4/5/22, 3:02 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Why do I feel like there is a mix up between Toxicity, Unfriendliness and plane bland personalities.
4/5/22, 3:02 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Plain*
4/5/22, 3:03 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Most HOs that passed through ENT will argue he had a mixture of all 3
4/5/22, 3:03 PM - +234 703 505 6225: 😃😃😃
4/5/22, 3:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

If you are toxic then you are unfriendly.

Who was plain bland among them?
4/5/22, 3:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’m of the opinion that these assertions vary widely across the entire class. There are people who would easily connect with people like Nimkur simply because their personalities align
4/5/22, 3:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think I had a great connection with Dr Ige for example
4/5/22, 3:06 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Nimkur obviously. 
The other Adoga made me buy ENT books for primaries then. He was super friendly, ready to teach and understanding
4/5/22, 3:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Abeg list the Titan that can connect with Nimkur😅

Okay Dan Guful did👏🏼
4/5/22, 3:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While the functional expectations of these guys in their roles as teachers may be uniform, I think there is room for a lot of variation in expectations of their personalities
4/5/22, 3:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Are some personalities better suited to the lecturing or mentoring role? Certainly. Sadly our systems do not factor these in selection of lecturers
4/5/22, 3:09 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
4/5/22, 3:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I liked Nimkur. If he didn’t have anything to offer, he didn’t bother to show up. No time for banters. If he showed up, he exchanged his value and left me time to play my games or do something else that was meaningful.
4/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 703 505 6225: I agree with you to some extent. 
Once I understood his kind of personality, we never had issues. And he actually has side to him
4/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 703 505 6225: 😃😃😃😃😃
Now I see why you defending him
4/5/22, 3:14 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In retrospect, I realize that I liked all my teachers. They didn’t need to be friends with me to pass on knowledge. And as long as they provided that value. They stay great in my memory.
4/5/22, 3:15 PM - +234 806 566 2895: <Media omitted>
4/5/22, 3:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The few who went the extra mile to be friendly are appreciated and have remained a part of my network. The others who didn’t bother are still in the good books.

Lol

You don't have to like all of them. It doesn't make you a bad person.

Some were nasty and don't deserve accolades.


A picture of Agbaji was posted. All the comments so far are showering him with praises. And he is still a teacher.

If you are nice you are nice and people will appreciate you for that
4/5/22, 3:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣🤣
4/5/22, 3:29 PM - +234 703 656 1230: This is undoubtedly a good man abeg. That's how it should be. I don't need my teacher to remember my face. All I need is after introducing myself it should be enough to smile and be welcoming or something.
4/5/22, 3:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He is trying to be politically correct
4/5/22, 3:29 PM - +234 703 656 1230: Simple.
4/5/22, 3:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Human side matters in knowledge sharing

4/5/22, 4:03 PM - +234 806 537 0692: The tales we are sharing today is not about liking or disliking our Teachers ...

Infact, Teacher are not meant to be liked ... They are not seeking for your votes!

They are meant to impart knowledge in the best way they can and move on ... In the process of imparting knowledge one can catch some cruise and laugh at students when the drop purulent stuff ... Without demeaning them.

But the problem is when people let their personal biases and issues interfare with teaching ... Becoming petty, vindictive, aiming at destroying self esteem of the students, being sadistic and even wicked at times, rather than imparting knowledge in a fair environment.
4/5/22, 4:05 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Even the so called worst Resident or consultant we had have people they were cool with ... I was very cool with Drs Ige, Yilgwan, Bode Thomas among others .... But that doesn't mean I didn't see some of the things they said to my mates and cringe inward
4/5/22, 4:09 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Stop using your statement to paint others in another light.

They are just catching fun

Good memories and bad ones serves sweet with time.

4/5/22, 4:27 PM - +234 703 505 6225: And then what was your conclusion after watching the movie?
4/5/22, 4:28 PM - +234 817 034 1232: I agree with her on this na🤣

Then the prophet was still in the mountain with the gods.

Had she encountered us...that statement would not have been made
4/5/22, 4:28 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Pastor Ishawuru of Mount zion ministries.

4/14/22, 9:21 AM - +234 703 656 1230: My question is 
1. Who will be his deputy? Until that is known, he may not be the right candidate for Presidency. Because if it's still going to be an APC member (one of Buhari's aids) he'll most likely be so suppressed by his deputy and not have a say in many decisions or even worse.

4/15/22, 5:55 AM - +234 817 271 4735: Ipob treatment against it's people for collecting pvc
4/15/22, 6:31 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Not Ipob 

This is work of DSS and army with their recruits
4/15/22, 7:13 AM - +234 703 613 6886: How did you arrive at this conclusion?
4/15/22, 7:52 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The gods informed us😊
4/15/22, 8:09 AM - +234 703 613 6886: Oh, I see.
4/15/22, 8:41 AM - +234 806 092 4290: See what this terrorists are doing to their own people. IPOB is gradually grooming a terror group, the way the North groomed Boko Haram and bandits into terrorism. I can see the kind of freedom they are seeking for. If IPOB should get their "freedom" the indigenes will not have peace or have any human rights. Horrible
4/15/22, 8:50 AM - +234 706 656 2719: I will have love you to condemn this act in totally before accusing DSS  or solders .
4/15/22, 8:52 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Whether it is ipob or DSS it is not a good act 

The focus is who is largely responsible for the insecurity.

The Nigerian security is involved
4/15/22, 8:53 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Well it is easier to deceive people than to convince them they have been deceived.
4/15/22, 9:05 AM - Obekpa: Guy, I have sent you a video on telegram, was trying to post it here but it seems to large.
Those guys are 100% IPOB.
Its obvious the government was never wrong in painting them as terrorist
4/15/22, 9:10 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

Seen it 

Of course there will always be fringe elements 

Just like genuine endsars protesters where there were few hoodlums involved and the government with DSS used another set of hoodlums to make the protest illegitimate.

Which they used as evidence to massacre victims

Hope you saw the videos of DSS with the hoodlums 

Or should I still post it as refresher😃
4/15/22, 9:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Just like the killings going on in plateau and benue villages

It has government backing too na for land grabbing and RUGA
4/15/22, 9:12 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Anyway I know the futility in trying to convince people 

But whenever we have the strength like now...we will keep repeating it as usual

Lol
4/15/22, 10:59 AM - +234 806 566 2895: IPOB denied responsibility for this

If IPOB did this, they won't deny it

I'm not saying it DSS
4/15/22, 11:08 AM - +234 806 092 4290: IPOB will not accept it openly. If they are serious, let them fish out the bad eggs amongst them. These are obviously the ESN they empowered with arms. They may not have done this by "order from above" but by the ideology sown into their heads
4/15/22, 11:10 AM - +234 806 566 2895: They admitted some others brother. These may be breakaway factions agreed but without top sanctions

It's not IPOB, I think. No reason for them to do it and not admit it. That undermines the entire activity
4/15/22, 11:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Terrorists don't deny responsibility 

Has boko haram denied any terrorist attack? That is the modus operandi of terrorists

Check the national dailies right from August last year they have always denied responsibility including sit at home

Even as of last week they still issued statement against attacks
4/15/22, 11:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly 

Wonder what they will benefit from this sef
4/15/22, 11:15 AM - +234 806 092 4290: But you understand my point. IPOB is not a terrorist group but ESN they have empowered with arms can turn out to be one. Whether IPOB, ESN or not, these are Igbos terrorising their own
4/15/22, 11:26 AM - +234 817 271 4735: I may agree with you that ipob is not responsible but it's obvious that they carrying out this activity on the platform of ipob. Ipob fish them out
4/15/22, 11:28 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The government agency tasked with fishing them out will overpower them if an attempt is done to fish them out because there is collusion
4/15/22, 11:29 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay o
4/15/22, 11:30 AM - +234 817 271 4735: So, you're telling me no one knows these people in the East
4/15/22, 11:33 AM - +234 817 034 1232: They caught some....because certainly there are rogue breakaway elements 

But the bulk of the attacks still come from security disguised as ipob 

Reason being that the attacks are too clinical and surgical to be carried out by untrained ipob.
4/15/22, 11:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You ask no one knows these people 

The link is there.

Same way it is difficult to fish out killer herdsmen in plateau and benue...same way it is difficult to trace these guys in the east.

Reason: because the military is involved

4/17/22, 7:44 AM - +234 803 950 6634: Hmm thank God
4/17/22, 8:51 AM - +234 803 052 3166: This might not be the time for it but I will suggest either all the doctors in the community (Kwan) do a solidarity march to the community head/gatekeepers to register their displeasure and give an ultimatum or totally leave the community. Its obvious that this happens based on insider information.
4/17/22, 8:53 AM - +234 803 052 3166: Unless a bold step is taken they have discovered a gold mine and it will continue.
4/17/22, 8:56 AM - +234 803 052 3166: A riot act should be read to the community because this persons are not aliens. The time to act is now for doctors in that community or they will have no peace.
4/17/22, 8:56 AM - +234 803 052 3166: Christ is risen indeed! Happy Easter All.
4/17/22, 9:00 AM - +234 706 656 2719: <Media omitted>
4/17/22, 9:01 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Sorry o

But nothing will happen.

Almost all the victims doctors or not in that area can testify that these kidnappers are Fulani speaking individuals

 Obviously they are not
 residing in that community of Kwan.

So how do they come from a distance to achieve this act.

They have security backing

And if that issue is not addressed; nothing will happen.
4/17/22, 9:01 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Great news
4/17/22, 9:04 AM - +234 803 052 3166: Bros, but how do they constantly enter the same community?
4/17/22, 9:05 AM - +234 706 656 2719: Newborn alert !!!!!Another good news!

Jude Ben Ameh’s family welcome a newborn baby Boy !


We thank God for this beautiful heavenly gift .

God bless the child !
4/17/22, 9:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Chief

They enter smoothly and go out without resistance because the share the proceeds of their loot with the military 


Remember when policemen intercepted some of them in Taraba state. The military opened fire on the policemen and they died.

Till today nobody has been jailed and the names are there.

The country is just hopeless.

The best that can be done is to equip the vigilantes secretly. And it has to be with Ak-47. Because these kidnappers are equipped with the same.

Of course the police will tell you it is illegal to acquire Ak-47 as an individual or community police.

My advice: don't listen to them.

Desperate times calls for Desperate measures.

In the daytime pretend you community police has hunter gun....at night they should be ready with Ak-47 too.


That's the only tenable solution for now
4/17/22, 9:12 AM - +234 803 052 3166: If nowhere else is safe, Kwan should be to some degree with the community of doctors there. If not then they are sitting ducks, any one can be next.
4/17/22, 9:12 AM - +234 803 567 4267: Congratulations to you and yours Jude. May he be amongst the best of people
4/17/22, 9:13 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Congratulations Jude

God bless baby and family
4/17/22, 9:17 AM - +234 803 052 3166: I fully agree with your views but the Kwan situation even though in Nigeria can be controlled to a good degree with commitment of the community. Doctors leading this can see this suceed as they are critical stakeholders or do nothing at their own peril.
4/17/22, 9:19 AM - +234 803 052 3166: Well come Jude Jr. Congratulations to the Ameh's.
4/17/22, 9:23 AM - +234 803 052 3166: Thank God. May none of us have to go through this experience again. May God continually  watch and protect us. Amen.

4/21/22, 8:15 AM - +234 817 034 1232: When Jubril bought the form in 2015; it was 20 million naira.

He has damaged the economy to the extent of selling the form for 100m.

How adults voted this man in 2019 remains a mystery.

And people will still vote for an APC candidate in 2023.

Humans! Lol.

4/21/22, 10:14 AM - +234 806 121 8220: The noise made about Cristiano Ronaldos hatrick against Norwich's city need to be repeated for Salah who scored 5 goals over the two legs EPL games against Manchester united in a season that sees the Red angels trashed the red devils 9-0 on aggregate. Its definitely a season to forget for the red devils.......since the departure of legendary manager, Alex Ferguson man united have failed to make a significant impact on the EPL even with the likes of David Moyes, Luis Vangal , José Mourinho, ole and recently the two German couches at the helm of affairs. Player's like ant. Marshall, Rashford, Maguire, pogba, Fernandez could  not return the red devils to the good old days. The signing of Sancho and the return of CR7 was celebrated by club and fans all over the world with high hope but the humiliation in an field says otherwise. My humble opinion have been that the return of Ronaldo have a negative impact in denying key players like Rashford playing time and taking away the confidence of Bruno Fernandez although he cont. To score goals to the delight of Manchester united fans....

On behalf of the Admins of this group, we sincerely appreciate everyone of us for the great support and love we have demonstrated in these difficult times.

May we continue to be one another's keepers and great family. 

With regards to current happenings ... We are presently raising fund for our dear sister Esther after shortly raising funds for our brother Slosh ... God Bless us Greatly.

Following these incidences, some suggestions have come up with regards to how to display the payment, so many people have shown concerns and made suggestions ...

We have looked into all the suggestions and we feel a more all-encompassing decision should be made and not just by only the admins.

Kindly read the next post and make a vote with regards to how we post information about donations here.

Thank you

Saw this and I was sincerely displeased especially with option 1.
Donations are voluntary and should be discrete.

What of someone doesn't have to give at that moment, publishing name, individual amount and total amount is very petty. Is it that everyone must know what another person gave?
Please we are all mature in this group. If someone makes a donation, post the total amount and let it be. Announcing who did what and the amount doesn't speak well....... My opinion. Mr A doesn't even need to know Mr B gave or the amount given.

4/22/22, 4:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: We must mention🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️
4/22/22, 4:31 PM - +234 703 656 1230: Bode leave me abeg. One thing we must understand is that no one is compelled to do what he or she can't. Just because names are published doesn't mean it will encourage others to contribute. 

I see other groups investing their groups savings to make millions that in turn help members in their group.

Av seen colleagues in other groups help their classmates with lucrative jobs 

Our own na to dey monitor who gave what and what amount...... That's so lame abeg

You have nothing other than a mirage of accomplishments with him. Make believe

He has achieved nothing and if he had any sort of integrity he would have left this government long before now. He doesn't even have the gumption to be honest about the failures of this government. We don't need such a gallless leader

His declaration speech should have dissuaded you against him. Maybe you haven't heard or seen it 😈. My brother, find that video
4/22/22, 6:45 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 👏🏼👏🏼

Betray what, because he is ambitious means he's courageous? Mtscheew

Bello you need a lot more information on these
4/22/22, 6:51 PM - +234 803 052 3166: That's where we usually miss it. What's the percentage of the grassroots/not literate do you find on social media. We give epistles while the war is on the streets.
4/22/22, 6:53 PM - +234 803 052 3166: These grassroots are the voters while the educated cast votes on social media and think their opinions count.

4/22/22, 6:57 PM - +234 803 052 3166: Please go to a typical northern state and ask about him in the communities and give a feedback
4/22/22, 6:57 PM - +234 817 034 1232: True

But social media is also a section of voters even though it's small

It was through vile media campaign of calumny that Buhari was able to get votes 
He was washed as white as snow...lol
4/22/22, 6:57 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Smart

Lol🤣
4/22/22, 6:57 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Do you know that osibanjo would have won the election outrightly of he had resigned from Buhari and contest now even as independent candidate
4/22/22, 6:57 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But whether they would declare him winner is another issue lol
4/22/22, 6:58 PM - +234 803 052 3166: Is it true Tinubu is decamping?
4/22/22, 6:58 PM - +234 803 310 4903: The fact that you were once thinking of voting colossal failure and Self deceiving governor like Yahaya Bello makes me doubt your ability to pitch tent with a good leader
4/22/22, 6:58 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yeah

His chances would be high

But I can understand why he didn't resign...he may be killed indirectly 🤭

It's the party's job to sell their candidate to all regions

The candidate's job to sell himself to the party delegates

Obi is doing exactly what he needs to

4/22/22, 7:06 PM - +234 803 052 3166: If he breaks the North, then the business can begin. Wishing him well in scaling the first hurdle - PDP primaries.

4/22/22, 7:17 PM - +234 803 052 3166: How many of them swayed to APC after the elections?
4/22/22, 7:18 PM - +234 803 052 3166: Buhari had his core support from the PDP, Jonathan's money.
4/22/22, 7:18 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That's an extremely simplified explanation and inaccurate too

We know why GEJ failed, security, media brainwashing, outlandish APC promises, strong northern candidate etc

Peter Obi has to secure primaries, for which he needs delegates. After primaries campaigns begin

You're also underestimating social media and the influence on even those people you call grassroot

Once the noise about a candidate ramps up without a good alternative those masses either vote the noisemaker or abstain
4/22/22, 7:19 PM - +234 803 052 3166: Just leave a lot in the closet bro.

4/22/22, 11:16 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The guy on the street unfortunately does not see it this way, they rather judge Osibanjo on the 120 days he was acting president and his decisive decisions within the period with palpable results( I remember the naira appreciated, Onnoghen was forwarded as chief justice even when the ruling party thought he was sympathetic to the opposition, he removed the then DSS boss; there was relative peace and decrease in blood shed). Of a truth, to the elite, he may have failed overall bearing the current circumstances, but many Nigerians think the cabal became uncomfortable and had to rush the President back, and believe he can hit the ground running immediately and can be his own man with the requisite sound team. He is the most travelled of all the candidates and to be honest his street credibility is second to None.

Mr Obi for me has his strengths and he is a better manager of the economy. We have borrowed the future of our children to peril and honestly we need someone to get the economy running. He is equally humble and not extravagant and with his think tank, can bring us out of the woods.

The two best candidates will be Osibanjo/Zulum vs Obi/?. I pray they can both scale through the party primaries. Once this hurdle is crossed, the rest is history for both and we may just have the closet election in our hands.
4/22/22, 11:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Abiola that's just grasping at straws

There are several candidates with better resumēs than Osibanjo. His presence in this administration till it's very end negates all perceived accomplishments

You talk about the man on the street? That's isn't what he will see, he will see what those spending money and promoting their candidate want them to see

No one remembers any 120days as acting president given a sleuth of disasters

I'm surprised you're crediting him with appreciation of naira😅. I don't even know where to start with that. It's take more than 3-4 months to appreciably improve the economy to the extent that it reflects on foreign exchange
4/22/22, 11:34 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Naira appreciating to me as a businessman is key and gives any investor some leverage to plan.

Unfortunately, his 120 days as acting president is what the man on the street remembers as any positive from this government. 

We need candidates to hit the ground running and not use their first term to learn on the job.

The Nigerian situation far outweighs the qualifications of candidates. We need leaders who understand our problems and provide solutions. We rather have a zulum who stood his ground against BH, and performed with meagre resources and have one who is Lily livered.
I rather have an Obi who left over 70 billion savings in Anambra without any debt than have someone come and learn on the job and 'borrow to service debts'.

I believe Osibanjo( not just my opinion) as his own man will act differently than under the directives of his Boss and the cabal.

On the flip side, if he had resigned will he be more marketable now as is theorised. 

My two best candidates remain Osibanjo and Obi. I pray any of them wins.
4/22/22, 11:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Drape him however you like, he's a man who's integrity is doubtful

He's also weak and that was inevident in his tenure and his declaration speech. If Osinbajo can say he wants to continue where this administration stopped is there anything else "the man of the street remembers?" but those dreadful words

Leave this talk of the man of the street, you know as well of that as I do and that's not what the man of the street where I've been remembers. Let's not dress up our sentiments as "the man on the street". You're not that and neither am i, whatever we claim regarding that is subjective

Please don't lump Peter Obi and Osinbajo together, they're not the best candidates. Peter Obi is the best candidate by a million miles. Osinbajo is a mirage.

That you think they're comparable is worrisome. Very
4/22/22, 11:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: *evident
4/22/22, 11:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your opinion is understandable Rowland. But your freedom to express your opinion ends where the freedom to express mine begins. 

Osibanjo to many is their next President and that includes the man on the street. To others their next president is Mr Obi and that includes the man on the street. But first they must cross the hurdle of their party primaries. No matter how good a candidate is, you and I can only vote for who a *party presents*, and you and I( nor the man on the street) can influence that, but rather the money bags and politicians do and that is why they both must play their politics well. Osibanjo saying he will continue with some of his principals policies even when we know he won't( he didn't when he was in an acting capacity not to even say when he becomes a substantive president), is him playing his politics well. You can't burn the bridges behind you and that is what he has done.

Like Isa said, after the primaries, that is when you and I have a say to determine who is president, until then I hope you have your PVC. 
This is beyond this social handle, politics must be played in the background to make your credentials count. It is not the other way round
4/23/22, 12:14 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂

How do you know he won't continue his principals policies?
Please convince me why you are so certain, that he'll do differently from what he's said? 

Tell yourself whatever you will but if you must debate publicly, then you need to provide evidence for your position. I can only take man on his words and antecedents. Nothing suggests Osinbajo is different from what he says

What has Osinbajo said to convince YOU he understands what ails this country and knows exactly how to fix it? Please let's drop this "the man on the street" , it's your position I would like to know, not someone who can't tell us for himself

You see why I'm so feisty and combative (forgive me if I offend, it's a passionate topic for me), this is how we ended up with Buhari. 

Let me explain, we chose to believe things that weren't there. Things that were different from what our eyes saw or our ears heard

When Buhari made incendiary statements people said noooo he's reformed, he's not a ethnoreligious bigot...till herdsmen started, kidnappings and Boko Haram pardons and reformation were hitting us back to back

We were concerned about his educational background but people said noooo it doesn't matter...now we have had no educational growth, rather back to back ASUU strikes

We said he's old, not fit, they said naaah
Then he started spending months abroad for treatment for undisclosed ailments

We said this man is not enterprising, no business to speak of outside of government, they said he'll plug corruption. Then the economy plummeted to hell

We said this man is a tyrant and they said naaah, he is a democrat...then twitter was banned and social media gagging was considered, wanton killing of protesters, Shiite, lekki tollgate

I can go on and on.

I want to help you see clearly, because if you think for a second Osinbajo would be different from what he's shown you, you'd be sorely mistaken. 

We are fighting for our future, we can't afford another mistake . In fact, I daresay we won't survive it, it'll be total economic collapse.

We have to be bold and select someone who ticks all the boxes and not someone with question marks

The only problem anyone can have with Peter Obi is simply ethnicity and that in itself is a shame...there I've said it

4/23/22, 12:45 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I shared the same worries for Buhari and people went ahead to vote him twice. And I knew we were in for it.For me, at the time, it was not a matter of when he will prove me right, but how fast can his tenure(s) can ease pass. We are ALL are better students of history Buhari is past is now, and like you said we must not make the same mistake with people with questionable character.

I don't think a weak person will remove a sitting DSS boss despite calls from the high and mighty to do the opposite, neither do I take likely a man who was acting president for a 120 days and they was little or no blood shed in the land. Nigerians want to be more secure and free to move from point A to B. If you understand really how the presidency works the VP is complementary and has really no say( even the economic decision his team makes must patch through Mr President).

His actions in the past will speak for him. He is likeable to the man on the street ( they always connect with him anywhere he goes to in the country- unfortunately you cannot deny this fact!)


Mr Obi is a perfect gentleman and I honestly feel Nigeria will be better managed under him than an Atiku. Wike may not have the temperament or emotional intelligence to unify the country, however, I think he will be firm and decisive with BH. Make no mistake none of these candidates are 100% saints. Osibanjo has his weakness, for example I see him more as a socialist( I hope Arome forgives me) giving arms and tokens to Nigerians. I rather want a leader who would empower Nigerians to be their own Boss rather than be civil servants or leave on a monthly token, and for me this is where I think Obi is better...

It will all boil down to who the parties put forward. Let's hope the put their best forward, though the best here might differ, but believe me Our next President may be Osibanjo or Obi. 

You think Mr Obi is ethnocentric? Is he as bad as Buhari? We just need men to get the job done. It's about, who amoung the candidates, despite their slight( unlike Buhari's case that was glaring) weaknesses, can get the job done.

Rowland there is no one politician out there who is 100% fit. It is how can we get the best out of the  'best' we have.

I would like to know other candidates you think are better out there than an Obi or Osibanjo?
4/23/22, 12:47 AM - +234 810 006 7926: *they
4/23/22, 12:57 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I never said Obi is ethnocentric. You must have misread that in my post
I said that's the only problem anyone can have with him...is his ethnicity

You are accruing too much credit to Osinbajo and I only wish you could furnish the evidence for proper dissection. There were periods under Buhari when they were minimal to no killings,early on at least before it resumed. So temporary abatement of killings IF true is unremarkable. I'd also say 120 is an eerily thin period on which to place such faith. The sample size is simply too small

Peter Obi is miles better, because we examined him for at least 8 years and even after. 

I'd suggest you listen to his interviews and compare with Osinbajo... It would illuminate their capacities better

If there was ever a politician that was a perfect fit, it's Obi. I'm not suggesting he is perfect but he is objectively the very best option out there and it's not even close.

Osinbajo is a no no for me, he's sullied, stained and anything from this government shouldn't be retained if possible

Donald Duke is a solid candidate but he isn't running, Moghalu is sound but quite lacking in credentials.

Every other candidate I think belongs in the wastebasket
4/23/22, 1:09 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Unfortunately, the candidate in the waste basket might be the chief cornerstone.

Well then at least we have one candidate we both agree on which is a plus.

Donald Duke is a visioner but can he be trusted with the Nations wealth. Moghalu is good on paper, but his antecedents is his stinct at the CBN and probably presidential debates? Are these enough to preside over Nigeria with the state it is? Your answer is as good as mine.

Obi is solid. He needs the support from the east and PDP to be fair to give him the ticket to stand a chance to compete and defeat the APC. Atiku and Wike has the money to be spoilers. Tambuwal is a third force no one is looking at. I'll rather see Saraki and Atiku in the waste basket, but let's hope fairness, equity, justice and competence guides the PDP and not money.

Osibanjo is top two for me and nothing you have posited here, has convinced me otherwise.

4 months is enough sample size for me to draw a conclusion with a slim error of margin in Nigeria and ruling out the confounders

But to each his own. People will believe what they must
Although I'll tell you this and end here. The following Peter Obi has now is even greater than GEJ in 2011. There'll be a storm if PDP muscles him out as it might signal the end of that party

But from you is encouraging

4/27/22, 7:25 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Addicts to Hedonism Have no Business as Custodians of Public wealth

https://telegra.ph/Addicts-to-Hedonism-Have-no-Business-as-Custodians-of-Public-wealth-04-22

By Celestine Kezie Jnr.

I listened to Peter Obi speak today in Owerri during his consultation tour to Imo. He said something that caught my attention. Talking about cutting the cost of governance, he said that even guests to White House in America pay for their food. E shock me!

I quickly googled it thus: "If you are invited to White House, do you pay for your meal"? This is an excerpt of the response I got:

"........the vast majority of the time the guests pick-up their own expenses. The White House has extremely limited budgets in those areas, almost non existent.

If an organization wants to have a grip and grin reception with the President then that organization pays for all the food, drinks, and any entertainment. Chef and Wait Staff will be White House employees".

Here in Nigeria, our consumption-driven politicians not only invite themselves to state houses as often as they want to make merry but also are picky about the drinks they take. Of course, Champaign is their favourite. They always go for it. 

Perhaps, they even sit down to discuss how to borrow more money over bottles of champagne .🍾 

God-willing this nonsense will be curtailed drastically if not stopped entirely. Addicts to hedonism should practice it in their houses with their personal  money not with tax papers money.
4/27/22, 7:27 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
4/27/22, 7:27 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This is the true Mr anti-corruption😅

Very smart man here
Made some strong points

I was always against zoning but I see his point
4/27/22, 11:29 PM - +234 806 566 2895: A must watch☝🏿
4/28/22, 12:10 AM - +234 806 568 3004: He spoke very well. Said the hard truth!
4/28/22, 12:18 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes he did

I knew we were in trouble but hearing it from someone else is often jarring. What he said about police is still giving me a headache. I couldn't have imagined it was so terrible

I also felt zoning had little advantage. But I understand better now

So many intelligent persons in the polity to allows idiots continue ruling us. It's a travesty
4/28/22, 12:27 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The idiots control the political forces. Technocracy can only work when the conventional politicians allow it.
4/28/22, 12:28 AM - +234 806 566 2895: The tide is changing. Not much else to steal, even their influence will begin to wane but it must start now. I truly do not think we are as helpless as we think
4/28/22, 12:29 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 2023 is very unpredictable. The people will have their say but the political elite will have their way. 

A south east Presidency still looks unlikely especially if the South west continues in the race. The north would like pull a fast one on us and still take 2023 again
4/28/22, 12:29 AM - +234 806 566 2895: We have just been programmed to think so. The apathy that is birthed from helplessness is designed to keep us for seeing that we can do something to wrest control of our futures
4/28/22, 12:30 AM - +234 806 568 3004: We are still helpless bro. Politicians will still be happy to control the resources of a failed state. It's all about personal interest for most of them and not about Nigeria
4/28/22, 12:30 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't agree

I think you're right about it being unpredictable but I think we are going to be pleasantly surprised.

But there is a storm coming
4/28/22, 12:31 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Storm coming from where? The divided masses or the twitter voters🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
4/28/22, 12:32 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I guess we will see

I don't think we are helpless. We just have to learn to unthink. Thankfully there's a new generation pushing for change that isn't as jaded or mentally handcuffed as we are
4/28/22, 12:32 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Those divided masses? Division is a fluctuant state
4/28/22, 12:32 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The masses don't even have what it takes to decide who will win the Presidential primaries. Where will the storm come from?
4/28/22, 12:33 AM - +234 806 568 3004: New generation are interested in leaving the country for greener pastures and enjoying entertainment on social media
4/28/22, 12:34 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😅😅😅
Oh my generation

I understand why you can't see some of the changes that are happening and why you need to see first before changing your thought or action
4/28/22, 12:34 AM - +234 806 566 2895: They do Francis, to a degree
4/28/22, 12:34 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Unity is continues to remain unlikely in view of the religious and ethnic divide. I doubt we can look beyond those and take our country back
4/28/22, 12:35 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The Peter Obi storm abi🤣🤣🤣
4/28/22, 12:35 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I want to see o!
4/28/22, 12:36 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That exact same generation is fighting, bullying, visiting delegates, carrying out door to door campaign and pooling funds for campaign without reward...just their future

They're not just making noise but you are denigrating them😃. They're doing more than you and I ever would
4/28/22, 12:37 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I get you but the last 7years have united us to a degree in suffering... That's all people need to be reminded of
4/28/22, 12:37 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Good efforts. But it needs to happen beyond the religious and ethnic divide
4/28/22, 12:38 AM - +234 806 568 3004: We are united in our struggle for survival. Politicians will soon take advantage of that and start sharing money. 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
4/28/22, 12:39 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Let's see how the primaries go. I have always said the main election is in the primaries.
4/28/22, 12:39 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You need to see.

You don't think you need to DO anything? 😂

Baba no wahala... One thing is for sure, this country will change in 2023 for good or finally disintegrate. Either way if it improves I doubt most of us would be able to take credit
4/28/22, 12:39 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂

If I had a dollar for everytime I heard this
4/28/22, 12:40 AM - +234 806 568 3004: In 2019, we didn't want either Buhari or Atiku, but the primaries forced them on us.
4/28/22, 12:41 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Do anything? How many Nigerians are genuinely ready to do anything for Nigeria. 

Start 'doing something' and you will realize that you are on your own🤣🤣🤣
4/28/22, 12:41 AM - +234 806 566 2895: We'll see

So here is something that will give you an inkling that I will be proved right. After accounting for population growth, PVC numbers will be the highest it's ever been since our democracy began
4/28/22, 12:41 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Like I said, you're jaded and old😅
4/28/22, 12:42 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
4/28/22, 12:42 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The elections will sha not happen on Twitter. Tinubu and co know this and are planning accordingly🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
4/28/22, 12:42 AM - +234 806 566 2895: And I voted neither

There weren't any forerunners then but now we have one. Wherever he goes so does the votes of masses
4/28/22, 12:43 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Oh yes it won't but Twitter is already coloring the elections
4/28/22, 12:43 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Assumptions! Forerunner will have his say but may not get his way
4/28/22, 12:44 AM - +234 806 566 2895: This message was deleted
4/28/22, 12:44 AM - +234 806 566 2895: True he may not have his way in PDP but those votes will follow him
4/28/22, 12:45 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Wherever
4/28/22, 12:45 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Minority that will make his be second runner up🤣🤣🤣
4/28/22, 12:45 AM - +234 806 568 3004: If he loses the PDP ticket, the game is almost over
4/28/22, 12:46 AM - +234 806 566 2895: The young may put too much stock in Twitter, the old put too little
4/28/22, 12:46 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I know anything is possible but it will be unlikely
4/28/22, 12:47 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The old are on the field where the real election will happen
4/28/22, 12:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Like I said you have been programmed to think that and you don't even know. 

That's why so many peri 40 individuals are very reticent and laid back

They're thinking it's not yet time😂
4/28/22, 12:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Not they're not

They don't have PVC
4/28/22, 12:48 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Time for us to run abi! Truly we are not to young to run🤣🤣🤣
4/28/22, 12:48 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Politicians that understand the game will follow the PVC and leave social media
4/28/22, 12:49 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I think it will be a historic electric. Another June 12 in the making😊
4/28/22, 12:49 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I truly would love for us to see Peter Obi muscled out of PDP and another party emanate and our president come from that third party so the APC-PDP hegemony wittles away
4/28/22, 12:50 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The third force theory! Possibly but unlikely!
4/28/22, 12:50 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I would love to see that happen😊
4/28/22, 12:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I didn't even mean contesting. I meant putting our foot forward in pressing support for our choice

The stakes are too high

Then again, I've discovered VERY VERY FEW of us have researched deeply into the aspirants. Much of what we know is common superficial stuff

Hence, the uncertainty of mind and purpose
4/28/22, 12:53 AM - +234 806 568 3004: It's not the reason for the uncertainty. 

You don't want to go on a journey and see that you are alone midway. 

How many people in Kano and Katsina will vote for Peter Obi if there is an Atiku on the Ballot🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
4/28/22, 12:53 AM - +234 806 566 2895: With any other candidate but Peter Obi I might have agreed 

People also have forgotten the influence of a solid popular VP
4/28/22, 12:53 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Our voters are not rational o
4/28/22, 12:53 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I just answered your question with my previous comment
4/28/22, 12:54 AM - +234 806 566 2895: And yet, they're not as irrational as you think

They're just poorly educated
4/28/22, 12:54 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Point!
4/28/22, 12:55 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Good debate presido

I'm almost always up for it😃

Well done for watching the video. Most people go Waka pass
4/28/22, 12:57 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I just believe our lives and our children's futures are at stake. Now is the time to be bold and aggressive about our actions. Else they'd have no country

Most of us as doctors can always leave, so there's a mental safety in that thought but our extended families would still be here

We have to fight for them
4/28/22, 12:58 AM - +234 806 568 3004: We all want a better country. In as much as the average doctor can easily waltz abroad, millions of people are struck in the country and we have to find a way to make it work. 

We are all patriotic but just don't want to waste out time fighting for a country that most people have given up on. 

We will remain patriotic and hopelessly optimistic🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
4/28/22, 12:59 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Same as my comment
4/28/22, 12:59 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Let's keep hope alive
4/28/22, 12:59 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
You're far from optimistic, as I was before Peter Obi at least
4/28/22, 12:59 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Gbam!
4/28/22, 1:00 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I work in Government and you don't want to know what I see that makes me want to give up. 

A good leader can start the process of fixing the country but we have a long journey ahead before we can get the Nigeria of our dreams🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
4/28/22, 1:01 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Let's see if Peter Obi can get the PDP ticket. Otherwise, I'm scared the dream will remain a dream🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
4/28/22, 1:03 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Me sef don see enough

I said this to a friend, I'm not naive enough to expect Peter Obi winning would see me in Eldorado. I just want progress, to even stop the decline would require years but there are things that would convince you of progress. That's all any reasonable person seeks
4/28/22, 1:04 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Hahaha

Una plenty for this boat. I'm not on it
4/28/22, 1:08 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Optimistic Rolly😊
4/28/22, 1:09 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Cautiously😁
4/28/22, 1:17 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 👍
4/28/22, 6:59 AM - +234 817 271 4735: Rowland, I like your zeal and optimism for a better Nigeria with Peter Obi as President. I share in your sentiments. I pray for him to win, he's our best choice so far.
4/28/22, 6:59 AM - +234 817 271 4735: How do we deal with the delegates and subsequently the people
4/28/22, 7:00 AM - +234 806 127 6477: Rowland and Francis.....i greet una ooooh. Una well done🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️
4/28/22, 7:06 AM - +234 817 271 4735: If you have done local research or privy to information from private researchers, you will realise we 3 types of voters;
1. Those who genuinely believe in a candidate with or without incentives. They're quite few
2. Those that will be told who to vote for either by religious, political godfather or tribal leaders. They don't have a mind of their own. They're a handful 
3. Those moved by money. Give them money and they vote for you. Most of them are unemployed and you know the prevalence of unemployment in Nigeria. They're also a handful 
What are the practical manoeuvres to convince these people that Peter Obi is the best?
4/28/22, 7:08 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

No need convincing them

Obviously they have not suffered enough to learn lesson on who is the best candidate 

Na body go tell them
4/28/22, 7:17 AM - +234 803 458 5862: Intelligent submission!
4/28/22, 7:19 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Good points Naka and thank you. I truly hope he wins

I'll tell you the much I know about the efforts so far

Right now some Peter Obi support groups have planned door to door campaigns to reach the uneducated masses and have been promoting him in the media and through other fora.

I know they were massively raising funds for the varied campaign strategies. They're trying to establish support groups in every state. They're state Whatsapp groups where they dialogue and address questions like advocacy visits to delegates to convince on Peter Obi candidacy

Far as I know some have verbally secured their delegates and posted such videos online showing their efforts. But you know you can never be sure. However, it cannot be discounted that some would be convinced

Now, the influence of money will always be there but less so than in previous years, despite worse poverty. Simply because people are enraged at this government and are "somewhat" wiser. I'm not negating the impact of financial incentives, I'm just saying it'll be less. Also if a candidate achieves national popularity and approval, I assure you the financial power of the bribers will dwindle even further

The main thrust of the Peter Obi's campaign is to make him a household name that all regions recognize as the best candidate for the presidency. Regarding some regions it will be easier with a popular VP from that area
4/28/22, 7:19 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂
4/28/22, 7:25 AM - Obekpa: Suffering is like a normal thing in this country.
It's just that it creates alot of insecurity for normal thinking human beings who are working hard to remain in the middle class else the current hardship in the country seems to be what fits majority of Nigerians.
If Buhari will be permitted to come out for a 3rd time he will still win a landslide victory in some regions.
We may be crying more than the bereaved as it concerns Good governance in this country, because the poor masses don't give a damn about it.
4/28/22, 7:26 AM - Obekpa: May God help us
4/28/22, 7:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Amin
4/28/22, 7:39 AM - +234 817 271 4735: Suffering in Nigeria is akin to some sort of religious righteousness. Beat that. You always forget that the ripple effects affects all.
4/28/22, 7:40 AM - +234 817 271 4735: That sounds practical
4/28/22, 7:41 AM - +234 817 271 4735: And feasible but put an "h" in my name or else...
4/28/22, 7:51 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Good morning Great TITANS!

Let's not relent on this support ...

A Gentle reminder!!!
4/28/22, 8:01 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba middle class no dey again

https://t.me/TakeBackNaija
4/30/22, 8:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Thanks for Sharing Roland. I joined in and it was a good discussion. My concern is that probably 30% of the people who joined in aren’t even in Nigeria. Probably 30% do not yet have a PVC, and as it was clearly observed literally 80% or more Cannot directly influenced the primaries that should make Obi emerge.
4/30/22, 8:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I hope that Doyin takes back the key message to Obi which is to find funds and play the necessary politics at this level of primaries to clinch the ticket
4/30/22, 8:33 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Oh that's nice

That conversation with Doyin Okupe was an eye opener

Yes I agree, but Doyin charted a course of action which was helpful
4/30/22, 8:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: All of the suggestions made to prohibit money in politics would be worked on in the long term not this election
4/30/22, 8:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't agree with this

That's not who Peter Obi is and it's exactly why we believe in him

I prefer getting 200,000 persons in each state or 12M strong than bribing delegates
4/30/22, 8:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother it's now or never
4/30/22, 8:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Summary of twitter meeting with Dr Doyin Okupe

1. Complete recognition of Peter Obi's place as the best candidate by delegates
2. Delegates are undecided despite recognition
3. Anyone to become a president in the country, the person needs at leads N150B to lobby and bribe
4. If youths are able to mobilize at 200,000 persons willing to vote Peter Obi wherever he goes and show leaders of PDP, they would acquiesce
5. If youths can secure a support group of 12M, the ruling parties are useless and can be abandoned for a third party
4/30/22, 8:40 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: He won’t get past the primaries with this mentality. Everyone loses a part of themselves in politics
4/30/22, 8:41 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There is ideal and there is reality
4/30/22, 8:42 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You heard what Doyin said. Everyone he has met has said they know Peter Obi is the best man for the job ...... but.. once a “but” enters, understand the rules are no longer ideal
4/30/22, 8:43 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Point 2 has money written over it. Delegates are definitely looking out for themselves first
4/30/22, 8:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They know that Peter Obi will not look at their faces post election
4/30/22, 8:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is their chance to chop. The idea of chop and still vote right is full of assumptions as Doyin said
4/30/22, 8:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: And that isn't the only route

I personally prefer the others
4/30/22, 8:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: These other parties don’t have the grassroots structures
4/30/22, 8:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Like I said, Doyin outline several courses of action which i tried to summarize
4/30/22, 8:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: PDP isn't the only route.
4/30/22, 8:48 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We are not yet at that point in Nigeria where people vote Candidates Sir. Party structures are still very much relevant. By this I mean, the various candidates at LGA level and State and zonal levels canvass for votes for the party as they canvass for theirs
4/30/22, 8:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Consequently a party with only candidates at a national level will require a whole lot more effort to defeat the others at those levels
4/30/22, 8:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You remember he said if you have 12M you don't need them?

He also alluded to the fact that PDP can bow to pressure and this is possible
4/30/22, 8:50 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree but it isn't the only option it's harder
4/30/22, 8:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 12m by 36 states is 333000
4/30/22, 8:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: So many states in the past elections didn’t even have that as total votes cast Sir
4/30/22, 8:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes, at least

But you can have more from larger states

Anyebe it's entirely doable. There's millions of people who have registered in this election that hadn't registered ever. Just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't 

There's a lot to do to get there but we need coordinated actions to achieve it
4/30/22, 8:55 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Neither have we seen this level of support for Peter Obi

The work is in securing it, grassroots campaigns very early, door to door. This will be coordinated in states, educating people on what to expect from those who would buy votes and what Peter Obi brings, how we can break the hold of APC-PDP if it comes to that. 

Anyebe it can be done
4/30/22, 9:01 PM - +234 806 092 4290: No Bauchi
4/30/22, 9:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Even Doyin Okupe with all his experiences completely believed that the other options are doable

The national support needs to chart a course of action that would be cascaded to state

1. Secure online and offline support
2. Strengthen state support group and increase numbers
3. Know the delegates and make courtesy visits
4. Pressure the delegates using media, marches and face to face visits
5. Begin door to door campaign with prioritization of areas analyzed to be most vulnerable (without information and prone to sell votes) 
6. Source for funding
7. More media campaigns at national and local levels to pressure PDP
8. Canvas a solid VP candidate
9. Source support by developing a register of people in agreement and use this to pressure the party


There are others but these are my ideas
4/30/22, 9:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I have to go
4/30/22, 9:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Oh my sorry baba, not all is available at present but you can start it and people would join
4/30/22, 9:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Just 2.4 or more people have registered Sir according to INEC from their targeted 20 million new registered voters. Bringing the total number to just over 86m
4/30/22, 9:08 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I wasn’t particularly impressed tho with his response to Obis plans for security. Everyone seems to just repeat the usual rhetorics 
:1. Rejig the Military structure 
2. Improve motivation and nationalism
3. Leadership. I don’t see anything new in that approach.
4/30/22, 9:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And the long term Improve education or course
4/30/22, 9:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’m more for candidates with blue prints. First 6 months bla bla bla . Within 1 year this this this and by 3rd year XYZ so we know how to measure performance
4/30/22, 9:14 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Anything before a But is a bullshit
4/30/22, 9:36 PM - +234 806 568 3004: If Peter Obi loses the PDP primaries, the race is over for him! 

#MyThoughts
4/30/22, 9:40 PM - +234 806 329 9675: He can work with Atiku as a running mate nau😡
4/30/22, 9:41 PM - +234 806 329 9675: 😜
4/30/22, 9:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: https://www.takebacknaija.org.ng/register.html#
4/30/22, 9:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes 

You don't know those people

But I'm saying when the total numbers are tallied they'll be record high. The 2.4M could be the people I'm speaking of or not

You need to relax. The information I have gleaned is many more will vote. There's time

You were the ones asking people to wait till after primaries and not do anything really... So be patient
4/30/22, 9:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It's not a debate and he said in one interview that he wouldn't go into detail yet, he seemed concerned other aspirants would poach his ideas

However,his plan is broadly sound in my opinion

The short term is improving the military, long term is evonomy
4/30/22, 9:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: No one of these candidates but Peter Obi will give you this

Plus this is usually at debates. None of the aspirants has even begun media tours that can assist in this regard
4/30/22, 9:49 PM - +234 706 098 3639: Thank you guys for the stimulating discussions regarding the elections....well done Rowland and Victor!
4/30/22, 9:57 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Peter Obi inclusive really has not got even the slightest idea how to revamp this nation in my honest opinion
4/30/22, 9:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Anyebe my hats off to you for attempting to participate

Doyin Okupe said something remarkable and I'm in total agreement. He said that Nigerians want change but no one is willing to sacrifice or fight for it, they think it will just come. That one leader will sweat and come and change things without our contribution

I want to charge us to do more than argue with me on why Peter Obi won't succeed but see what you can do to help US succeed. Most of us are so cynical, understandably so, that we would not lift a finger. We know Peter Obi is the best candidate but some of us wouldn't even go to vote him if he left PDP, so we waste a PVC. We aren't God and we can't be 100% sure we don't matter

It's your future, your children's future at stake here. It's worth fighting and bleeding for. You need to do much more than get a PVC. Get involved, contribute, brainstorm, steer actions of these younger persons based on your experiences. We have nothing to lose and EVERYTHING to gain

If you doubt Peter Obi is the best candidate then by all means do your research, watch videos online, judge his sincerity, spontaneity of responses and answers to problems posed, logic of proposed solutions. Then if you're assured please contribute.

We need everyone, I'm making this passionate plea, this country doesn't have four more years in the hands of a bad leader.

We need to do more, problems are only problems because you're without a solution. Let's think up solutions
4/30/22, 9:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ok that's fine
4/30/22, 9:59 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You're welcome Benjamin
4/30/22, 10:00 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’ll tell you why I arrived at that conclusion
4/30/22, 10:00 PM - +234 706 098 3639: 👍
4/30/22, 10:00 PM - +234 706 098 3639: 👍
4/30/22, 10:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Your opinion is your opinion Anyebe which is Peter Obi doesn't have the slightest idea how to fix the nation

Ok😊
4/30/22, 10:02 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Nigerias problems stem from the fact that we are still battling the concept of Nationhood in this country. No politician yet has the magic wand to appeal to every part of the country without a bias or accommodate all of the concerns without another part feeling disgruntled. Until we really achieve nationhood, we can’t even begin to discuss addressing economy and social ills or security.
4/30/22, 10:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: How will the nationhood be achieved
4/30/22, 10:03 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: A lot of these politicians speak as tho they have all the bases covered. Until i see someone who dissects the problems to the root cause, and then clearly acknowledges that a large chunk of the solution is out of their control but appeals to all major players to collaborate whilst committing to fully drive the parts within his control
4/30/22, 10:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Then I know we are just repeating rhetorics
4/30/22, 10:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Curious to know if any other candidate has capacity to fix Nigeria other than the likes of Peter
Because the only thing that can stop him is the satanic 1999 constitution
4/30/22, 10:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They will come in, be exposed to the enormity of the challenge as they never perceived it and begin to make the usual excuses if they choose to communicate or find stooges who will eternally make excuses for the Govt until they leave power
4/30/22, 10:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂
4/30/22, 10:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is the question nobody has been able to answer and it is why we remain where we are
4/30/22, 10:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The states are also a microcosm of this problem
4/30/22, 10:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You didn't answer Chibu's question
4/30/22, 10:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: My state is a case study.
4/30/22, 10:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I do not presently have an answer to that honestly
4/30/22, 10:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Fair enough, I sincerely appreciate your honesty
4/30/22, 10:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Tor
4/30/22, 10:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Have you realized that outside the shores of this country, Nigerians unite ever so strongly across ethnicities yet within the sures and particularly where politics is concerned the dividing lines are so glaring
4/30/22, 10:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Have you wondered why?
4/30/22, 10:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes

Because a heterogeneous society like Nigeria cannot succeed 

It's a simple straight answer
4/30/22, 10:08 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The average Tiv man acknowledges the idoma and Igede as brothers outside Benue but when politics or power is on the table, the dividing lines become obvious
4/30/22, 10:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: All successful countries are largely homogenous
4/30/22, 10:08 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think that the solution to nationhood is devolving the enormosity of power at the center
4/30/22, 10:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Anyebe Peter Obi answered this wonderfully in my opinion

He said all these agitations are a major consequence of poverty. The moment you improve the economy and improve people's opportunity to thrive, you cut down much of the disunity, then you can bring fringe groups to the table

He said that when the country thrives everyone wants to belong
4/30/22, 10:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The power of the presidency is too much and the reason why every region wants to be in control perpetually
4/30/22, 10:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: That solution of devolution is the magic wand. The day we stop sharing the money at FEC
4/30/22, 10:09 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Because you are competing in Benue for seemingly scare resources

That isn't the case outside

SIMPLE
4/30/22, 10:09 PM - +234 806 566 2895: True

Most
4/30/22, 10:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And states have to remit to the center and focus on generating their own resources we would continue to see the fight for power to spend what comes with the office

4/30/22, 10:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Victor

Long term, we are trying to stay afloat

You make it sound like it easy, that's long term
4/30/22, 10:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Pls list one

Let me tell you why it isn't
4/30/22, 10:11 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Scarce*
4/30/22, 10:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This doesn’t however explain the shared pride to be nigerian outside the shores
4/30/22, 10:14 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The assumption that poverty alone is at the core can be debated. I like the promise of Eldorado. However the process to lifting the economy is easier said than done. Recall that With every Govt that succeeded the previous, prices never went down.
4/30/22, 10:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Remember the popular statement that says “Money is money and Power is Power” . Alluding to scarce resources may not be absolutely correct. These societies have thrived before the economic declines. The same power tussles and permutations that exist now existed then
4/30/22, 10:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Also recall that whoever is coming in will inherit massive debts. For a country whose budget is often in deficit of earnings requiring a large part of it to be funded by borrowing esp when borrowed money will be ploughed into recurrent expenditure
4/30/22, 10:19 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The US, the UK, South Africa, are largely heterogenous societies by different criteria
4/30/22, 10:20 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The point is the issues that sway elections in these countries have moved beyond which region should be placated with the presidency.
4/30/22, 10:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Last point before I drop this discussion.
4/30/22, 10:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Recall that this hypothesis by Peter Obi that if the economy worked and everyone was” well fed “ , nationhood would be established and all of the ideals in place is actually a state that we did exist as in this country. 

When the North focused on its groundnut pyramids and agriculture while the west focused on Cocoa sending its people on scholarships from the earnings and the East focused on education with most of its indigenes occupying federal civil service positions and people were employed on the basis of merit. 
The same greed for “power” destroyed all of that and the country began to plummet. Now we are in a worse state where the north finds it very difficult to trust the East. I won’t sound pessimistic about chances but it’s a tall order to be realistic. Maybe the average Nigerian is ready for that. The political class are miles behind. I honestly pray we live to see the Nigeria of our dreams. 

Have a beautiful night.
4/30/22, 10:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Anyebe you're smarter than this

How many governments have been better than the previous?

Have we even had a good government?

Also, it's not even about the prices but the capacity of people to afford to pay for stuff regardless of the prices
4/30/22, 10:46 PM - +234 817 034 1232: They are largely Christian countries so it's not heterogeneous
4/30/22, 10:48 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Same can be said of Saudi Dubai
Muslim countries 

Well developed 

India Hindu developed

You are looking at it from cultural point

There is always something that will unite a country for it to progress 

Same cannot be for Nigeria...it is too diverse cultural and religious wise....so it will not develop
4/30/22, 10:55 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Plenty talk Anyebe

If you read one of my previous posts you'd have probably put your comments in perspective

It's easy to hypothesize, you have proposed zero solutions. It's easy to sound smart and intellectual analyzing problems, sadly that's not what we need. Although to be fair, you admitted to not knowing the answer

I'm not interested in digressing further. The question before us is simple

1. Who is the best candidate for Nigeria in 2023 out of all the aspirants? (How can we know-research)

2. What do we do to ensure that candidate is elected?

All this talk talk achieves nothing

If you think Peter Obi given his track record, and plans is poorly equipped to lead this nation, then tell me who you intend to support and what you intend to do to see that candidate elected

We have a candidate that recognizes for the first time the importance of education and the movement of the 21st century in terms of tech and understands that we must invest in tech. His investment as governor in education is why Anambra is still one of best performing states in WAEC and literacy rates. The first candidate that has emphasize education, a neglected sector

He understands the importance of trimming down the cost of governance, which is why he was impeached. This and other investments helped him save 80+ billion dollars for Anambra.

His recognition that micro businesses and SME are a key driver of economy as several countries have shown. This man travelled to over 30 countries just to learn why some countries as successful as they are... basically residency training😅. 

A seasoned businessman that correctly understands that we have been borrowing wrong, that is for consumption, rather than production. A simple but relevant analysis I daresay.

But Anyebe says he has NOT even the slightest idea how to fix the country? Ok man😅

Victor I think you need to be clear about our immediate and long term needs. Right now we need save, produce and invest wisely. As well as set a standard for governance so people learn a different way to do things

Every other thing is secondary.

Some notable points from Peter Obi's visit to Brekete radio today

1. During his time in Anambra, they were the first state to conduct a statewide poverty analysis. They tried to analyze why some communities and regions were poor.
They found out that the poorest communities were had no access roads.
So they invested in creating road networks in rural areas that allowed farmers bring their produce to town to sell. This, he mentioned alleviated poverty in those areas in Anambra

2. Every person older than 70 years was paid N5000 monthly... regardless. Amazing they still had money saved

3. When asked how can leaders still hear the voices of the common man? 
He responded by saying that when he was governor they held town hall meetings every 3months. 
During this time he would get feedback and areas visited previously like schools were prioritized.
This was to ensure that accountability regarding promises made.
He recalled where he promised a school 10M to fix their roof and forgot. At the different meeting in the community, people were asked to give feedback and a JSS1 student picked up the microphone. She said he didn't keep his promise to her school and there and then he asked his commissioner of education to make out a check before the left that community

*Food for thought*

5/4/22, 5:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Focus on the primaries Roland and the coast will be clear, even though it will be a close one. Your efforts now will only make sense after he has won the primaries, then Nigerians can then decide.
5/4/22, 5:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That's what you think and what they want you to think.
The effort starts yesterday
In fact I'm even late. 

Even if he doesn't win the primaries baba wherever whenever

Your man needs APC, mine doesn't. I intend to ensure he doesn't.
5/4/22, 5:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: All the best Roland. My candid advise
5/4/22, 5:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Save us some air
5/4/22, 5:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Thanks Abiola, I won't take it though. I wish I had the time to explain why but you probably won't get it on Whatsapp
5/4/22, 5:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I'm sorry if you're offended. Truly but until a majority of people on this forum say so I won't stop
5/4/22, 5:57 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Save us some air Roland
5/4/22, 5:57 PM - +234 817 034 1232: No air will be saved o

E get why
5/4/22, 5:57 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I'm sorry Abiola, I will not save YOU some air
5/4/22, 5:58 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol
5/4/22, 5:59 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Is Abiola for osibanjo
5/4/22, 5:59 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

In 2014 I remember how Rowland lamented before the plague Buhari came in 2015.

Now we have witnessed 8 years of total destruction 

The worst president in history

So it is better the alarm is being sound in 2022 before another disastrous candidate will come in 2023

The alarm is in order
5/4/22, 6:01 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Abiola do you know how many people fought Rolly because of messiah Buhari in 2015?

This one na small🤣

Because whoever is going to be elected will likely spend 8 years not 4
5/4/22, 6:02 PM - +234 810 006 7926: We are better informed than you about your candidate, believe me I don't need the rhetorics. The man on the street does. My bet is between my two bishops and they both start with O( Obi and Osinbanjo) but these guys must win their primaries and that is where all the energies must be domiciled. Until then all these ' efforts' will not count until after the primaries. It appears to me your putting the cart before the horse.
5/4/22, 6:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba it's amazing people think this is just another election

If you understand the precipe we are currently on, you'd know my actions and more are warranted

Current trajectory of this government and you'd be unable to travel anywhere by road, north or east or south. They've kidnapped two people in one class in two weeks

Government is servicing debt with 97% of revenue and you're looking for AIR😅

Salary no go dey in four years with a bad leader. If you run, your parents still dey here😂

Baba I'm sorry my posts dey pain you but until the house largely says no, MBOK, no AIR😅

I will do my best to help educate people to vote right
5/4/22, 6:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
5/4/22, 6:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Issorait
5/4/22, 6:03 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He didn't know who Buhari was and I hope he gets some direction this time
5/4/22, 6:03 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We understand! It's this kind of understanding that was used to convince us that GEJ needed to go. 

We moved from Frying pan to Fire😝😝😝
5/4/22, 6:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: How 

He knew who Buhari was

And he warned a lot of us

His antecedents speak for him
5/4/22, 6:04 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ese sir

I didn't even shout enough then

This one eh, omo

Soro soke gan
5/4/22, 6:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
5/4/22, 6:05 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Another 8 years 

We go hear am
5/4/22, 6:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂

Then man on the street again? The one collecting rice

That man on the street that only Abiola hears😃
Haba guy!

You can easily ignore Sha since you're more informed it should be easy

I really wonder how sure you are that you're better informed
5/4/22, 6:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You didn't get this point
5/4/22, 6:07 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Buhari was never to be.  My apologies for those who voted for him twice
5/4/22, 6:07 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Omo! I no follow o

They didn't sell us anything solid about GEJ, watery stuff but no one cared to research then
5/4/22, 6:07 PM - +234 806 566 2895: He didn't read that comment well
5/4/22, 6:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: If he says he is better informed then he is 😃
5/4/22, 6:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂
5/4/22, 6:08 PM - +234 803 658 2567: What air are we saving ?

Ride on Soldier 🌹
5/4/22, 6:09 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Chibuzor did you vote for Buhari?
5/4/22, 6:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think that @2348100067926 position is clear. And he has cut it down to two candidates on both sides of the divide Osibanjo and Obi
5/4/22, 6:09 PM - +234 817 034 1232: We still have one full year with Buhari o🤣🤣
Will officially start my count down in June
5/4/22, 6:09 PM - +234 806 566 2895: <Media omitted>
5/4/22, 6:10 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This message was deleted
5/4/22, 6:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: What Abiola is simply saying is, on this Titans Forum, we get it. Obi is the man to transform Nigeria. Where this energy needs to be focused now is the delegates who will vote in the primaries. Unless Roland knows something else we don’t about a few delegates amongst us, this work done here is with less impact
5/4/22, 6:10 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Why would I do that🤣
5/4/22, 6:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Naaah Victor na Osinbajo man😅

Him never get mind talk... 

Na joke o
5/4/22, 6:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😫
5/4/22, 6:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Though I believe in second chances

But people hardly change😊
5/4/22, 6:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We do not have doubts about Obis capabilities
5/4/22, 6:12 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If only we could play the behind the scene politics to get our candidates their party tickets, it will be better use of my time
5/4/22, 6:12 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And to @2348065662895 I hope he wins the PDP primaries cos if he doesn’t, these videos and beautiful placades about Obi will be stored in Yaradua library in central Area and Obi would be the best president we never had
5/4/22, 6:13 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤦🏿‍♂️
5/4/22, 6:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Alternatively and this is me sweetening the pot. If you strongly believe the Obi movement can trump APC and PDP in a national election on the platform of another party. I pray it happens and I’ll give you 200k to celebrate that
5/4/22, 6:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Summarily, work for the emergence of Obi as PDPs flag bearer
5/4/22, 6:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He talks like He is already President and that all the work that has to be done is on social media. There is so much politicking to be done beyond typing on this social handle
5/4/22, 6:14 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba see eh you cannot underestimate the impact of a group like this

People selling this candidate to their families, friends, church members, patients... Delegates is small

Also you guys probably skipped a post I dropped here

Getting delegates to side with Peter Obi without bribing is unpredictable. There are other strategies that have been put forward. All you need is ask

Funny thing is, quite a number of people have reached out to me with questions, some have gone to get their PVCs, other have begun becoming invested and researching more
5/4/22, 6:14 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I'm not sure I'm reading this right or a typo?
5/4/22, 6:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Reread
5/4/22, 6:16 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Titans una hear abi? 😁😁😁

I sincerely hope he wins at another party not because of this money but because of what it will mean for our history as a nation and our mindset

200k will also be nice😁
5/4/22, 6:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You keep making the case against bribing for Obi and I do not support bribery but you must understand that in the history of the world, Great revolutions have never being driven by decency. Even our salvation required a form of murder to come by
5/4/22, 6:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: And you know I'm not doing this how?

Abiola you're not aware of all I'm doing except what happens here. You need to chill

I don't know why you're so worked up😀
5/4/22, 6:18 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ok 

I know you had doubts recently that's why I thought it was a typo or you were speaking about me not having doubts
5/4/22, 6:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Typing dey pain hand

Me no support bribing and you can understand why he won't

If a doctor was coming to treat you, would there be any justifiable reason for him to pay you? 🤷🏿‍♂️ That's how Peter Obi thinks. If he bribes, he will collect later

Everyone thinks there's only one way to do things until someone does it differently😊
5/4/22, 6:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Delegates are the bride of the primaries. 40% of them are former ministers, senators and governor's who don't have the wield of their current governor and have a mind of their own. Majority will reject your money. The other delegates will be given kilishi from all candidates and it will now be between their conscience or who is the highest bidder. 

Our politics sadly has been monitised with merit sacrificed. That is not to say we don't have delegates with a mind of their own. The beauty is that the monitised delegates will be split
5/4/22, 6:22 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Well said
5/4/22, 6:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Believe me I'm one of the calmest person's on this blog and have a clear head
5/4/22, 6:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This is where our energies and background work should be, not here Roland.
5/4/22, 6:24 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You're making too many unfounded and categorical statements that cannot be proven😓
5/4/22, 6:24 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You can do yours and I do mine na

Just because you think it's the right approach doesn't mean it is Abiola

Or are you never wrong?
5/4/22, 6:25 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Wish you well Roland. Focus, focus is key. The less noise and more background work, the more victory is certain
5/4/22, 6:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother it's noise to you, I apologize. Turn down the volume. If you're as reasonable as you seem to think, you would have ceased cautioning me as you're one voice in this group and one other person has said I should continue 

Abiola I just told you here that some persons in this group have chatted with me personally asking for more information and have started the process of getting informed and getting PVCs but that doesn't matter to you... Just "noise" as you call it

Baba if you wan promote Osinbajo, go ahead😃. I will only debate you on the merits of your position if you so desire to humor me.

But post I shall, till the masses say it HAVE DO
5/4/22, 6:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Never really had doubts about Obis capabilities generally to Govern. My concern if I recall was that most aspirants were repeating rhetorics and I remember talking about a blue print. I still listened to him at Berekete family today and wasn’t left ululated particularly about his solutions to security. Most of them long term. 
You can’t tell that to the Benue men dying everyday at the hands of herdsmen or the people in Zamfara and Borno and talk about education and empowerment to prevent youths from becoming security risks and hazards.
5/4/22, 6:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Even as Scientist we are taught to address problems with solutions cascaded into Immediate mid term and longterm
5/4/22, 6:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: What we need now as a country is a drastic solution to security. Death penalties for kidnappers, bandits who are caught etc but none of these politicians has the balls to say it out as a large chunk of this problem is in one section of the country and they don’t want to offend the majority
5/4/22, 6:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol. Nigeria’s combined wealth is way more than this. It’s called a trade off. If that politician takes back his 150billion but eliminates and blocks all the loopholes for further stealing @2348065662895 I will support him.
5/4/22, 6:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree that he didn't expantiate but he said something I think was key, not only to successes in Anambra in terms of security but elsewhere.

Vigilantes, homegrown security outfits paid directly from source and not the communities. Community policing

But I wish we could talk face or at least phone. I'll call you sha

But I'm not even saying Peter Obi has all the answers, some he will learn in office. What I'm saying is that he remains our best choice by a mile. And not just makeshift but an actual leader that will bring change
5/4/22, 6:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Who steals and block loopholes for further stealing 

For where

Lol
5/4/22, 6:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother they're not catching them 

Also Peter Obi will not say some things now till either after primaries in order not to lose support of some persons he'll have to criticize

Do you understand?
5/4/22, 6:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Simple
5/4/22, 6:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂

That's naive Anyebe

Thief no dey block hole

If you think him go stop at recovering him money, you need to shine ya eye
5/4/22, 6:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly😂
5/4/22, 7:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: On your last point, I agree. Valid points made.
5/4/22, 7:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol ok
5/4/22, 7:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Truth is he really doesn’t have to steal. There are very easy ways I. This country to recoup

5/4/22, 7:21 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Good evening House ....

We appreciate everyone for their support...

Tomorrow is 5th of May, we planned for tomorrow to be the deadline of this contribution ...

We encourage us to push a little more and support Esther Johnson (nee Edwards)
5/4/22, 7:40 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Noise is when you keep hearing something you already know over and over again. If only we could channel some of the energies here to getting the delegates vote for the two best candidates in my opinion, then it will be a productive use of our time.
5/4/22, 8:26 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Abiola do as you think is best for your two best

I will do the same for the one candidate I think is worth anything

I'm pretty easy to ignore. Just scroll when you see my posts😊. If you can't do that, don't worry, I usually stop after elections
5/4/22, 8:30 PM - +234 805 611 8622: Rowland abeg nau. Do you want me to see Peter Obi in my dreams?
5/4/22, 8:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Please o😂
5/4/22, 8:35 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/4/22, 10:28 PM - +234 806 329 9675: While we put all these political brouhaha to rest, I wish to *thank you all in a very special way* for the birthday wishes & prayers. Remain blessed great minds/Titans.🙏🏼
5/4/22, 10:45 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Happy Birthday to Omame and Winifred. Best wishes🙏

5/5/22, 10:32 AM - +234 803 755 0266: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=5629482737065878&id=100000126227244&sfnsn=scwspwa
5/5/22, 10:33 AM - +234 803 755 0266: But I still feel at the last minute things can turn around at the primaries table
5/5/22, 10:34 AM - +234 803 755 0266: I love the fact that he is not buying any delegate
5/5/22, 10:36 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
5/5/22, 10:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The only politician that I can trust to remove petrol subsidy and the money will be put to good use
5/5/22, 10:41 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It can but there are strategies in place if that fails

What I have been trying to achieve for weeks now is to imbue people with the belief that regardless of the two big parties if we have the numbers then we will be difficult to stop in any party

But people are struggling to unlearn old ways of thinking and think if PDP doesn't fly Peter Obi then he's done. That man is aiming to be president but he's not desperate. He wants to inspire the masses to demand better leadership if they believe he is it and if they don't then that's fine

We just need to be united in our decision on who the best candidate is and then be willing to go to any length to see that person elected
5/5/22, 10:43 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true

Osita Chidoka said the same thing. He said Peter Obi's popularity is similar to Buhari in 2014-2015, that if Buhari wanted to remove subsidy Nigerians would have acquiesced because the country trusted him that much
5/5/22, 10:44 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Thank god the criminal did not remove the subsidy 
Because they are diverting the small one that has been removed
5/5/22, 10:46 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Honestly it would have been brutal, nothing gained
5/5/22, 10:49 AM - +234 803 755 0266: Yes I believe if he gets another party it will definitely be automatic ticket
5/5/22, 10:50 AM - +234 803 755 0266: It will then depend on the masses at that point
5/5/22, 10:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol
5/5/22, 10:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes, that's why the mobilization must begin now not later
5/5/22, 10:51 AM - +234 803 755 0266: All of us to actually come out because most of us don't come out to withstand the rigors of voting. That's why others seem to out way the elites. If it is raining an average street man will still go out and vote but we the so called elite will recline and say it's raining
5/5/22, 10:51 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Unfortunately, Nigeria system would not allow him
5/5/22, 10:51 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He will lose if he gets another party
5/5/22, 10:55 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

The truth is that if you analyze voting and voters you'll find that the uneducated are those who vote our leaders in

Middle and high income sit at home and soliloquize. That's why I have focused on my contacts and people I know. Na them no dey comot go vote😅

Nearly 20 persons I have spoken to were unwilling to vote or even get their PVCs.
5/5/22, 10:56 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Not true Chibu

It'll be an uphill task but definitely not insurmountable.

In my opinion it's the best for the country
5/5/22, 11:16 AM - +234 817 271 4735: That is the watchword- masses-the majority that don't have a mind of their own
5/5/22, 3:00 PM - +234 817 034 1232: This election will be held in approximately 119,973 polling units and about 8,809 wards across the country. 

Seems more polling units have been added ahead of the election 

Peter obi will need at least 2 agents at all these polling units. 

119,973 x 2 = 239,946 agents 

Assuminh, each party agent is paid 30,000 which comes up to about 239,946 x 30,000 = 8, 818, 380,000. 

This is close to 9 billion.



He should also have 2 or more agents at the ward vote collation centers. Say you pay these two guys 30,000 Niara each it will come up to about 8,809 x 30,000 = 264,270,000 

In total it will cost him roughly 10 billion naira just for this on election day. 

We have not talked about the campaign yet. 

The job of these agents is to be the contestant's eyes and ears at the polling units and also to help facilitate the rigging machinery if need be - because this will happen 

Only parties with state governors and structures can help Peter Obi achieve this, if we are to face reality. 

Only two parties can achieve this. APC and PDP. 

Even in the western world it's mostly two parties. Trump spotted this and won. 

The recent French election last week was a race between two parties. 

E go hard Peter obi or any other candidate to constitute a third force and win. 

Humans are mostly programmed to engage in binary thinking😀. Either black or white. They don't like grey areas. Lol
5/5/22, 3:02 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Some of these security agents and INEC agents will want to scuttle your votes 
So you have to also settle them and have men on ground to stop them if you don't want to settle them
5/5/22, 3:07 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😅 I like that you outlined the hurdles on that hill. I'm not unaware but your assuming he has to pay for agents first

People are donating for free for Peter Obi's campaign. Current donations at mostly 1k before primaries is 4M and you think he'll struggle to find people?

They'll do it for FREE😀

Secondly, the machinery of the state is definitely a daunting factor but it's still down to how much and how massive Peter Obi's support becomes. If it's large enough, authorities will behave and instead reserve the fight for gubernatorial
5/5/22, 3:07 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Very realistic
5/5/22, 3:08 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Are the agents contributing?
5/5/22, 3:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I mean that's not a hurdle given his support, paying agents isn't a challenge. The real challenge are the institutional hurdles

I'm a little busy today. Gotta go, I'll catch up later
5/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 817 271 4735: This message was deleted
5/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 817 271 4735: ... and leave me and the fake prophet
5/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 4 million to 10 billion

They will run out of steam before next year that is humans for you


Even our current donation for Esther have we not run out of steam

This is just an example

And you can't possibly get over 200,000 agents to do it for you free.
There is danger of them being lackadaisical about it
5/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Those institutional hurdles will require huge party support and structure 

Let's just hope he clinches the PDP ticket
5/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Obi is the only Aspirant so far that has stated in practical terms how he will solve some of our national  problems. However, I fear he might have  openly played his card and the establishment will do everything to frustrate his emergence as Nigerias president.
5/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 706 656 2719: This guy ! Where do u come from ???
5/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol
5/5/22, 3:14 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Exactly my point.
Will those people in want someone that will "take food out of their mouth"?
5/5/22, 3:15 PM - +234 817 271 4735: He has ran away already even before the election
5/5/22, 3:15 PM - +234 817 271 4735: He has to clinch that ticket oh, if not...
5/5/22, 3:16 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Just bring realistic 😃

 Thank you and remain blessed!
5/5/22, 3:30 PM - +234 703 199 4953: Keep it coming, many thanks people.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
5/5/22, 3:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I'm not naive enough to assume it's easy but in research your approach would be correct.

When trying to find predictors or a cause of an outcome you compare it's past behavior and similar diseases.

However, when some new variable intervenes, you may have a different outcome. I'll use this analogy to simplify my point. For as long as EBV infected children in temperate regions, infectious mononucleosis was the outcome. Once EBV interacted with malaria, Burkitt's lymphoma arose.

What I mean is that I understand your cynicism and it arises from a past analysis of naija. You are not entirely wrong but your model may be off. This is the first time in recent past people are contributing to spearhead a campaign, common people not politicians. This is a proof of how desperate people are.

Do you remember agberos rejecting bribes during ENDSARS campaign that police tried to offer? That was unheard of. My point is that there's reason to be hopeful

You can't let yourself be lose without even a fight. My mentality is this...

1. Peter Obi is the best candidate and I believe the one candidate that can fix this country

2. How can I contribute to get him elected despite the huge challenges ahead?

3. Win or lose I want to know in my heart and when I see my kids in the morning that "I fought for us"

4. As a Christian, the very foundation of my faith is hope in the unbelievable. I tell you, if Peter Obi were not in this election you won't hear peep from me because I for don dey plan exit options. But I believe God gave me hope by him stepping forward. It's my turn to do my part


The question ultimately Chibu is this, if he loses primaries, do you believe there's nothing YOU can do, desperately teeming masses believing the contrary?
5/5/22, 3:55 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I have an exam in a week... Relax.

Someone was looking for fresh air here yesterday, you no talk say you still want my noise o? 😃
5/5/22, 3:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

I don't know if I want that, except it's the only path to victory which I don't think
5/5/22, 3:57 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Get to the oza room🤨

5/5/22, 4:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Well we needed a Buhari to truly appreciate a Peter Obi

Will be contributing once he clears the primaries

Which he will likely do

PDP is in a tight corner...except they want to prove they are a useless opposition party
5/5/22, 4:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lmao
5/5/22, 4:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Amin
5/5/22, 4:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly, Buhari made us appreciate Peter Obi

Truly ethnic sentiments would have clouded our eyes regarding Obi but what we have become united in our shared suffering

The public are ready to light PDP on fire
5/5/22, 4:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Amen
5/5/22, 4:31 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Please do we have any colleague working in PH? Any of the government specialist hospital

Nothing can be left to chance or to people’s good will. If history has taught us anything, it is that when push comes to shove, the good will of most Nigerians is often sold to the highest bidder. More so when in the face of this severe economic downturn.
5/7/22, 11:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: They're are aware.

But we aren't at that point  yet. Push for the PDP ticket but plan in the interim. It's still primaries point

5/8/22, 10:12 AM - +234 817 271 4735: As at Thursday, The National Organising Secretary of APC, Alhaji Sulaiman Arugugu, Said;

1. 241 aspirants picked senatorial forms x 20m each = 4,820,000,000

2. 821 aspirants Picked House of Representatives x 10m each = 8,210,000,000

3. 1,505 aspirants Picked States House of Assembly x 2m each = 3,010,000,000

4. 48 aspirants Picked Governorship x 50m each = 2,400,000,000

5. 15 aspirants Picked Presidential x 100m each = 1,500,000,000

*Thursday total = 19,940,000,000 (19 billion + approx)*

They have raked in close to N20bn while the citizens continue to suffer and everything either going down or is in reverse.

Does strike affects only students?

If 20,000 students make a trip to the campus by public transport with an average of N200 daily, that's N4m.
If 20,000 students eat lunch at school at N200 daily, that's another N4m.
If 20,000 students photocopy 20 pages of document at N10 each daily, that's another N4m

By this, just 20,000 students inject N12m daily to the local economy.
During 3 months of strike, N1.08bn is lost by transporters, food vendors, business centres.etc. 
Expand this to the actual number of students in the Universities in the country.

*The write up below is an interesting read.*

"ABOUT PETER OBI'S SON, 

After the faux outrage that Obi's comment about not buying a car for his son about 30 years of age because he believes that he should work to get one for himself, generated, I decided to do a little background check on his son. Below is what I've been able to come up with. My candid opinion on the matter is offered as a postscript at the footer.

Oseloka Obi is Peter Obi's only son and a graduate of Philosophy from Bristol University, UK.
He is a Hollywood actor and a member of the Actors Guild of Great Britain UK and goes by the stage name ELOKA IVO.
He's done a lot of stage plays and recitations, most notably teaming up with Dame Harriet Walter and Gemma Whelan to perform a reading of Timberlake Wertenbaker's 'The Third' at London Burough of Islington in the UK.

His major casts include the movie, "His Assistant" and a sci-fi series "Avenue 5".

He's also done voice over for several Ebooks on Amazon.

Oseloka has worked in various firms which includes Assistant Production Manager at AFRIFF, Lagos and Business Developer at Kombini, London, UK.

In 2018 Oseloka Co-founded TBA which is a Movie Theatre Company in Bristol City, UK.

PS: It's so refreshing to see a Nigerian politician who does not believe that his status as a public office holder is what his son should run with to access privileged positions. I'm genuinely surprised by the number of people who expect Peter Obi to buy his grown up son a car when he's actually set him on a pedestal to global fame and fortunes, having given him the most important virtues of Good education and values. What is a car in comparison to that? 

Obi's style of leadership pales greatly to what obtains amongst Black Africans: the wanton obsessing for materialism and the worship of same. This understandably irks the living daylight out of many who cannot understand how a Billionaire's daughter is rather a public school teacher in Lagos as opposed to being a top Executive in NNPC like her peers, and his son having to hustle for his own car.

Coming from a people used to seeing the children of top politicians flying private jets and power bikes of over 40m naira while having no known source of income, I really really do understand. Obi is not your regular Nigerian, and it's so refreshing to see.

5/13/22, 4:29 AM - +234 806 092 4290: One of her killers. They may be more than 20. Sadly, these are "higher institution students" killing their class/seat mate
5/13/22, 4:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Being a graduate doesn't free your mind from killing someone on behalf of a human being or any God.

The process of being open minded requires a lot of unlearning and relearning what you have been taught.

Atiku, Shehu Sani is not likely going tokill you if you criticise his faith, he will engage you in debate or ignore you if he cannot counter you.

But El rufai, Sanusi, Pantami who went to school will kill you. 

It's safer not to expect much that education changes mindset
5/13/22, 4:38 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Even though some (probably this one inclusive) have been reportedly arrested by the police, they are unlikely to face judgment. They will be detained for some days and they will walk free or probably be rewarded with scholarship to school abroad
5/13/22, 4:39 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Very true. I think Sanusi should be in the opposite group
5/13/22, 4:45 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Sanusi that supervised the killing and beheading of a student called Gideon Akaluka in 1994.

Same way it was done to Deborah yesterday.

We only got to know of hers yesterday because of speed of information.

Sanusi fled the country afterwards. You know Abacha was looking for him.

Have you wondered why under Abacha terrorism did not flourish. It's all about mindset; despite him being a looter.

Looks can be deceiving and Sanusi fits the description; speaking impeccable English and dressing well cannot hoodwink the discerning mind 😃
5/13/22, 4:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True
5/13/22, 5:01 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Amen. Action should be condemned and everyone should practice his or her religion anywhere. This freedom of getting away with these serial occurrences must stop. Videos like these divide the country along religious fault lines. Christians should be free to practice Christianity anywhere in this country
5/13/22, 5:03 AM - +234 810 006 7926: ' *Nobody will'* until *'someone does'*
5/13/22, 5:14 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Never heard of that. Maybe after he flew he unlearned and learned. I have listened to him speak against such acts and many more primitive practices on several occasions.
But how come he was not made to face the law but was made CBN governor by GEJ
5/13/22, 5:27 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Same way Isa Pantanmi is currently the minister for communication after leading the killing of Sunday in ATB University 

These things are out there.

You are likely to be rewarded  if you have terrorist views
5/13/22, 5:30 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The truth is that religions like Buddhism, Jainism and others which offer you no reward whether here or hereafter tend to be peaceful 

Just watch the adherents and antecedents as evidence

5/13/22, 7:04 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Deleting his post for political reasons would have been the wrong move.

I don't think he deleted his post.
5/13/22, 7:06 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Okay
5/13/22, 7:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The two accounts are different because he posted on both Facebook and twitter
5/13/22, 7:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He has deleted the posts

5/13/22, 8:03 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Measure your expectations and have peace! 

You have said it all!

Nothing will happen! 

Some hotter news will make us forget and in a few months the bros will be released for lack of 'concrete' evidence and inconsistency in the account of witnesses. 

I assure you that no witnesses will even come forward. A 'good' lawyer will say the video may have been altered to the disadvantage of his client. 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️

No God or god would approve killing

5/13/22, 9:56 AM - +234 810 006 7926: We can't continue like this Francis . Life is a gift and sarcosant. No body has the exclusive right to violence. Religious extremism only thrives if the person at top tolerates it.
5/13/22, 10:09 AM - +234 810 006 7926: You are right until  you are proved wrong.
5/13/22, 10:54 AM - +234 806 954 1554: Congratulations Dr Ifeoma
5/13/22, 10:57 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I agree with you totally. But it is what it is. 

We will continue to dream of a Nigeria with minimal ethnic and religious bias. 

Until then we will continue to know what is right but these sentiments will prevent us from doing them.

5/13/22, 11:31 AM - +234 706 815 1299: If one was not not taught from childhood that killing someone else is evil, sorry, you won't just easily unlearn this evil all of a sudden as an adult. Childhood training is the critical influence of adults behaviours. Sadly so. No matter how busy we get to be, let's inculcate the right morals in our children pls.
5/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I think the next discussion should be how these religious grievances can be handled by the formal law courts. 

They such Imams should educate their people on the formal legal channels so that they don't resort to extra judicial killings.
5/13/22, 11:40 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Then such Imams
5/13/22, 11:54 AM - +234 703 714 8734: <Media omitted>
5/13/22, 12:55 PM - +1 (437) 982-2656: I agree but the problem here is that your trained child will still have to deal with this breed of people in the society. It’s more about a system that allows for such. The biggest lie we’ve been sold and continue to tell ourselves is “one Nigeria”- we would have to share the same values as a people and if we can’t even agree on a simple thing as the right to life/ respect for life, what then really unifies us apart from the fact that we’ve been told that we are a nation. How a sane person can justify that act is just incomprehensible and if there’s anyone here who in their heart of hearts thinks that’s okay I just pray that the love of God will fill your heart. Yes I went there
5/13/22, 12:58 PM - +234 706 815 1299: Yes! You've got valid points here.
5/13/22, 1:00 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The actions of the mob that killed Deborah are highly condemnable and I condemn it totally. 

It is sad to see people of “Repute” take a stance so extreme and interestingly I respect that they have openly taken a side with their full chest.
5/13/22, 1:01 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I won’t over flog the point that education alone in itself is not a guarantee to value for life
5/13/22, 1:02 PM - +234 803 658 2567: It was the "Yes I went there" for me. 

The truth really needs to be told.
5/13/22, 1:03 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: What we have to deal with is super sensitive. A people have been spiritually nurtured a certain way. And will pass same thru generations. How we as a nation got here is not surprising to be honest. Where we go from here is what should be a front burner
5/13/22, 1:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is not a problem particular to Nigeria. It is widespread thru Africa. The British, German, French etc did a proper study of African ethnicities and understood clearly that if this continent was to stay retrogressive, the best way was to merge people of completely different mindsets, emotionally, spiritually, physically and otherwise in supposed Nations. We are not ready for the solution. 

I feel for the north. While a few Christians get caught in this web of violence every now and then. The repercussions of the “Deafening” silence already reverberate and will continue for years to come. More often than not we stay silent till our own houses, family or people are touched. My cousin was kidnapped over 3 years ago by BH and till today we have not seen him. In fact we have literally lost hope. 
The chicken will always come home to roost
5/13/22, 1:25 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Another thing we have to know is that even the Muslims that do not support this act of extrajudicial killing can't openly criticise the act as they are subject to the Islamic law. These are sensitive issues that can only be addressed by the higher powers that want a change, especially the religious leaders.
Many have learnt the act of humanity and religious tolerance, but it doesn't guarantee their safety coming up openly to criticise what those above believe its right.
5/13/22, 1:32 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Our Christian leaders should also take time to educate people on how to control their tongues (Bible also emphasises this) and respect other religious beliefs. Even if you want to preach the gospel to anyone, you can do that without talking down on what they believe in and are sacrosanct to them. We are already in a volatile world where anyone can be slaughtered for just taking in oxygen that is freely given to everyone, talk less about when you openly step on toes. Our safety first, then we can be alive to change the system, hopefully.
5/13/22, 1:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: She didn't do any of the above if you ask me. We need to tolerate our differences if we must remain as a country with a heterogeneous mix. If we can't, then we need to follow our heads and not our hearts
5/13/22, 1:43 PM - +234 703 505 6225: I had nightmare after watching that video. 
It was barbaric and should be condemned by all.
I'm glad the Sultanate came out to  condem the act  but it shouldn't stop at that, the perpetrators should be punished. 

I listened to the audio of what the girl said, agreed she did not display wisdom,sensitivity and understanding of her  environment, but that should never lead to ending her life in 2022 Nigeria.

5/14/22, 8:21 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Very insightful perspective..
5/14/22, 8:34 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Controversial Omokri's perspective is as usual controversial. Is either we say it as it is, rather than play politics round sensitive issues
5/14/22, 8:40 AM - +234 803 281 3842: This message was deleted
5/14/22, 8:40 AM - +234 817 034 1232: This perspective doesn't make sense

Useless perspective to justify murder
5/14/22, 8:40 AM - +234 803 281 3842: **not
5/14/22, 8:41 AM - +234 803 281 3842: He didn't justify anything chibu...Read the piece with an open mind.
5/14/22, 8:42 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Exactly. How does a mob killing an alleged robber equate to religious extremists killing one for alleged blasphemy. It's the same murder but by two different groups with different ideologies
5/14/22, 8:42 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Am not sure I see the controversy in this piece..he has drawn attention that our condemnation isnt targeted at Muslims nor northerners but at the perpetrators and supporters of that gruesome murder...that's fact,not controversy..and there's no politics being played with that conclusion. Yes, Reno would always try to be sensational in stating his point, nonetheless, his point is germane .
5/14/22, 8:43 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I'm not sure he even understands the article he wrote
5/14/22, 8:43 AM - +234 817 034 1232: I read it Austin

This kind of perspective will embolden another killing by blasphemy

After all southerners kill each other therefore killing should continue 

And the clown Reno had to bring it now.

Have you seen Buhari's speech concerning the killing. The terrorist justified the killing and even did his own blasphemy ontop
5/14/22, 8:44 AM - +234 803 281 3842: You miss the point sir ...both killed. The premise for that murder is not important. Human life is to be honored and the mob killing a suspected thieve is on the same boat as Deborah's killers.

5/14/22, 8:45 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Or saying Jesus rose like Agege bread, mean we burn the bank manager alive?.
5/14/22, 8:45 AM - +234 817 034 1232: And the terrorist still justified Deborah's killing. When next he sees Renos write up he will be justified
5/14/22, 8:46 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I think Reno should be mute and perish any self seeking relevance he is trying to seek recently
5/14/22, 8:46 AM - +234 810 006 7926: He just nailed his relevance in this country
5/14/22, 8:46 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

He is entitled to his speech
5/14/22, 8:47 AM - +234 803 281 3842: We are comparing apples with oranges...what buhari said and Reno said are not the same sir
5/14/22, 8:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Mob killing is always wrong but one person was a criminal and the other was not
5/14/22, 8:48 AM - +234 817 034 1232: I don't take him seriously. Well only when he criticises Buhari because he is always in the news for the wrong reasons😃

Someone who is fixated on female vaginas and female fidelity. 
He has deep seated issues
5/14/22, 8:48 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Both people's fate needed to be determine by the laws of the land. And in some lands,both are criminals. Nonetheless, the law should have determined the fate and not some energetic youth with a match and fuel.
5/14/22, 8:49 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
5/14/22, 8:49 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Thank you Row.

I believe Austin now understands his response to Abiola
5/14/22, 8:49 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Are u serious gentleman?
5/14/22, 8:49 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's where you are wrong 

Deborah fate did not need to be determined by another

She committed no crime. What are saying Austin?
5/14/22, 8:50 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Austin in the constitution of Nigeria and according to criminal law, please point out Deborah's crime?
5/14/22, 8:50 AM - +234 810 006 7926: His argument is fractured and the premise of his argument flawed. He should leave the lawyers do their thing .
5/14/22, 8:50 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Gentlemen, your emotions are pretty high and I beg to discontinue this debate. Good morning.
5/14/22, 8:51 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Austin according to Nigerian constitution we are a secular state.

Why should Deborah even be tried at all.

To think that it is her classmates in the same WhatsApp group that killed her. This is worrisome
5/14/22, 8:52 AM - +234 806 092 4290: There's no controversy to what Reno said. All acts are condemnable. Whether a the if or a blasphaimer, no one deserves extrajudicial killings. Let the law takes it's course. Reno was one of the first to condemn the barbaric act. I have read a lot of comments on social media, and I am sick of the idea that all Northerners are beasts or barbaric or all Muslims are these or that. As he stated, let's focus on the perpetrators and stop generalising things.
Few weeks ago we saw one of the most inhumane acts in history in the East. Those murdered by the so called UGM were probably not Northerners or definitely not Muslims, and the perpetrators are of course Easterners.
We have monsters everywhere, only that some regions have more of them
5/14/22, 8:53 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I've tried not to weigh in on this whole thing.

This whole mob justice yada yada yada. Mob justice has always been evil and to an extent a society determines how to treat criminals but if you can't prove Deborah is a criminal then what are we even saying

Please let's focus and leave Reno Omokri and his wahala. He sounds reasonable probably twice a week
5/14/22, 8:53 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Exactly

5/14/22, 8:54 AM - +234 817 034 1232: When are you guys going to kill or beat up people on behalf of Prophet Chibu

You guys don't value me na...always calling me prophet of doom or false prophet
5/14/22, 8:54 AM - +234 806 566 2895: O boy I just tire o

Same classmates wey you dey see everyday

Do you know how dead inside you have to be to murder an acquaintance not a stranger?
5/14/22, 8:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Twice a week is a stretch.

Twice every 3 months and one of the contents includes Buhari
5/14/22, 9:00 AM - +234 806 954 1554: Congratulations
5/14/22, 9:02 AM - +234 806 329 9675: *Supported!*✅

Guys, I think we should leave this sensitive and emotional topic to rest PLEASE🙏🏼
5/14/22, 9:03 AM - +234 703 013 1067: That's to say religion is a dangerous thing to deal with.
5/14/22, 9:04 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Chibu, what are you up to. Must everything Buhari said be misinterpreted? He has not blasphemed Jesus Christ. He is not the first to recognise Him as a Prophet.
Good enough, Jesus Christ does not care much about the general opinion of who He is. What he is concerned more is what YOU, ME, HE or HER regard Him in the individual's lives. For example, you and I don't regard Jesus same way, but it He is still what He is. That's why no one can fight for Him, but should rather fight fir his soul
5/14/22, 9:07 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Was the Sterling Bank Manager burnt alive for blasphemy against Jesus? Was he told to watch his uterance?. His excesses was tolerated. 

Im not in support of her speaking the way she did. But burn her alive, is extreme and should not be politised with mere condemnation or public speech. The people involved *must* be brought to book.
No body has the monopoly of violence.

 *Omale a mob burning an alleged rubber( motive for crime robbery) is not the same with religious fundamentalists burning a woman alive for alleged blasphemy( motive for murder: blasphemy).* 

Trying to say the two scenarios are the same is politising the issue and for me Reno trying to gain traction and relevance of late is unwarranted.
5/14/22, 9:08 AM - +234 810 006 7926: *robber
5/14/22, 9:13 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Just like Austin, I am done. Why do we keep going out of context and repeating the same thing. Tell me who said it was right for Deborah to be burnt alive or killed? The subject of this argument was that no extrajudicial killing is right, and because some animals from a certain religion or region have committed a crime, does not permit us calling all the people from that religion or region animals.
Focus on Reno's point and not emotions. We have animals and criminals everywhere, and each act should treated exclusively
5/14/22, 9:20 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't know why people are even comparing the two

And point of correction Abiola. She was stoned, beaten alive and postmortem and then burned

The truth is that tolerance needs to be taught in Islam to the grassroot, because there are different opinions on how to deal with offence against Islam. 

The real question is how many Islamic scholars believe in tolerance and what would their approach be in such scenarios

If only people understood that you're insulting of Jesus or Mohammed na only you e dey pain not them

I believe this group has Titans who are both Christians and Muslims. 

I advise that such things has already put a rift between us and our Muslim Titans.

Pls while I am not in support of what happened to Deborah, let's stop all these post abeg.

Since the beginning of this year I ha e not read ONE COMMENT FROM any of our Muslim Titans and its cos of all these kind of posts. Haba guys.

5/19/22, 11:30 AM - +234 803 310 4903: Started btw traders in the timber market vs okada riders, 
The thugs came in and it became Hausa thugs vs igbo traders. Market and cars got burnt. 4 ppl got killed unfortunately. As you can see from the video, the hoodlums left the market and jumped into the road attacking innocent drivers. Typical tactics used by hoodlums from certain extraction whom have mastered the art of killing and maiming innocent ppl
5/19/22, 11:36 AM - +234 803 281 3842: The grey camry driver should have run over one of them guys

But to answer his question, this patient though symptomatic, may not benefit from a carotid artery endarterectomy because studies suggest that patients who benefit from the procedure are symptomatic patients with high grade stenosis (70-90% occlusion ). This patient will benefit from anti platelet therapy (aspirin), a statin, and careful BP control.
5/20/22, 12:25 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/20/22, 12:39 PM - +234 806 939 9882: According to NICE guidelines, patients who have suffered from either a TIA, moderate occlusion (50 to 69%) or severe occlusion meets the criteria for an endarterectomy. Which the index patients falls into two of the categories. 

I believe she would benefit from the procedure. However, she would benefit from those adjunct management plans you laid out.

5/20/22, 12:43 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Interesting! The Americans tend to be a bit more conservative. But I can see how the patient would benefit from a more aggressive course of action especially considering the fact that they’re symptomatic.
5/20/22, 12:44 PM - +234 817 034 1232: These were the few words we wanted from her😃

5/21/22, 10:29 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The flip side may be true. I don't think Obi should and will. He is the best. Atiku is not sellable. He has lost since 1992 and is not likely to win. Dont worry Wike will checkmate him and Obi wins. Though a third force is Udom.
5/21/22, 10:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Pdp will loose woefully if atiku becomes the flag bearer something if Tinubu becomes APC flagbearer
5/21/22, 10:32 PM - +234 703 013 1067: If Atiku becomes the PDP flag bearer which i can't be so sure, we'll have a peaceful protest for him (Onions) to decamp to APGA and there we'll cast our votes.

5/21/22, 10:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Where you dey get all this watery info?😅

Peter Obi is many things but inconsistent isn't one and he has said he isn't running for VP. Baba rest that yarn
5/21/22, 10:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Pdp is on a keg of gun powder
5/21/22, 10:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: APC and PDP just keep postponing their primaries, each person waiting to see whom the party selects.

If PDP selects Atiku I promise you, that APC picks Tinubu. If Peter Obi wins the primaries they'll push Osinbajo😅
5/21/22, 10:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This message was deleted
5/21/22, 10:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yeye people
5/21/22, 10:37 PM - +234 703 013 1067: *(Obi)
5/21/22, 10:37 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Now more sense made . Firstly, under the leadership of wike, southern governors have heard several meetings and agreed that presidency is coming to the south and they are all in unity over this. I think wike is in the race to check the process, he will checkmate Atiku dollar to dollar and can only hands off for Peter Obi for the sake of fairness and justice which he wike likes to stand for. Tambuwal may likely pair with Peter Obi as VP
5/21/22, 10:37 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Of course. After losing primaries he will be offered the VP ticket. He will accept it and plan to ascend to President in 2027🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
5/21/22, 10:37 PM - +234 703 013 1067: *(Obi)
5/21/22, 10:38 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Just a few days to go. We are waiting for the political magic😊😊😊😊😊
5/21/22, 10:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
Ayomoh this your political aptness don dey lose enough megabytes since JUMSA

I go laugh you when the times comes, vice versa
5/21/22, 10:40 PM - +234 806 568 3004: No wahala! Let's wait and see. It's a game of predictions! Nothing is guaranteed!😊😊😊
5/21/22, 10:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Guy you be learner o. GEJ type no dey 2😅

Who will reign for 4years?

Plus who has this much support and settles for VP? He won't risk losing. Peter Obi isn't desperate for power and he has realized the VP won't cut it
5/21/22, 10:42 PM - +234 703 714 8734: NNPP will also seek a southern merger(maybe with APGA) if they want a serious shot at the presidency, but I don't know if kwankwaso can play Tinibu and take a VP spot for Peter Obi, incase Peter Obi doesn't get PDP ticket
5/21/22, 10:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: How much control does a VP have? 

Peter Obi is consistent. Watch his interviews 5-6,7 years ago, the message is the same

If the msn says he isn't going for VP then he isn't and won't
5/21/22, 10:43 PM - +234 806 568 3004: If he loses the primaries it is over bro! I don't see him winning in any other smaller party!
5/21/22, 10:43 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba oil dey your head

That's a definite Plan B. A solid alternative
5/21/22, 10:44 PM - +234 703 714 8734: It depends on if kwankwaso can chill, for the greater good
5/21/22, 10:44 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Another angle! Unlikely for Kwankwaso to accept to be VP to Peter Obi. Plus I don't see Peter Obi leaving PDP if he loses the primaries
5/21/22, 10:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Toh

You've said so before, I differed. We will have to see

For me I'm mostly tired of analysis without proactive steps to see our dreams through.

Na there I park my bus now. We can soliloquize all day but the outliers and greats find a way to success when others say "Naah, it can't be done"

I'm all for making history
5/21/22, 10:45 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Remember, Peter Obi has said he is not desperate to be President. He will be asked to pull his weight in PDP as VP to help the party win Presidency
5/21/22, 10:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Unlikely but possible
5/21/22, 10:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: His submission is what is flying around. But believe it is a propaganda to shelve OBi out.

Atiku believes we got 12 million votes, forgetting some people wanted Bihari out and His deputy Obi pulled the numbers.

His 'corruption tag' and religious sentiments may not endear him to many.

Atiku is not in this race to make Nigeria better but to fulfil a personal dream. If he doesn't become president today he may have to wait for another 8 years and age is not on his side. The older you are as a candidate the less appealing you are to the electorate. This is the same dilemma with Tinubu, if he doesn't become president now, it will take him another 16 years and age is not on his side. 

I think the pre 1992 politicians should take a rest and take a honourable bow and be king makers.
5/21/22, 10:46 PM - +234 703 714 8734: The momentum behind Peter Obi can not be killed by a failed PDP Primaries, same as for Tinibu
5/21/22, 10:46 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Detailed plan Bs are being made
5/21/22, 10:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree but it's about what he stands to gain. Seeing Peter Obi's support, knowing they could form a mega party to drown the two established ones?

It's all about the marketing
5/21/22, 10:46 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We are supporting you as witnesses of history being made!😊😊😊😊
5/21/22, 10:48 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Just a few days away from 3rd June
5/21/22, 10:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Lol you haven't been listening to his interviews. Let's leave it at that. I guess we'll have to see and we will both learn

1. If he loses the primary and VP slot, then he is no different from other politicians

2. If he doesn't, I hope it'll teach to dream that some politicians are cut from a different cloth
5/21/22, 10:48 PM - +234 703 714 8734: VP to who ?
5/21/22, 10:49 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Atiku probably🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
5/21/22, 10:49 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Kwankwaso is NNPP presidential candidate. Tinubu may decamp to SDP if passes @2348066751526  scrutiny
5/21/22, 10:50 PM - +234 806 568 3004: History about to be made😊😊😊😊
5/21/22, 10:50 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes, I know that submission is flying around

But Abiola you should know rumors are sometimes just that rumors. Occasionally even peddled by opposition to cause borderline voters to remain just that

Anyone who has truly watched and listened to Peter Obi speak will know, he realizes that only as president can he fix the country and not in 2027, right now
5/21/22, 10:50 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Atiku can't fly this time around like before, wike and southern governors have great weight in the PDP, wike appointed the current NWC
5/21/22, 10:52 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Of course! But he has to win a primary and a main election first! No doubt He is the best man for the job but the system may not allow him emerge
5/21/22, 10:52 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Let's see what the delegates decide😊😊😊😊
5/21/22, 10:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Everyone knows he's a stale, unmarketable product, not appealing on sooooo my fronts

1. Voter apathy, you don too run (we gave you chance, you didn't save us from Buhari)
2. It's the turn of the South but oga still wan collect 8years
3. Fulani
4. Extremely uncharismatic
5. Career politician
5/21/22, 10:54 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Wike can sacrifice himself for any other southern candidate, but Atiku is not in the options, remember his recent attack on Atiku,Saraki and tambuwal as the people who betrayed PDP and brought in Buhari to punish nigerians. By his statement, he means these people do not deserve a vote or a ticket
5/21/22, 10:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Hence, there are ways to vacate the system but not with analysis from front of television o baba
5/21/22, 10:55 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 😊😊😊😊😊
5/21/22, 10:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Streets gats feels your pulse presido
5/21/22, 10:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes. Your right.
5/21/22, 10:56 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Let the permutations continue! I believe we will  be shocked with the results of the primaries.
5/21/22, 10:57 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
5/21/22, 10:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: See this agbalagba😂
5/21/22, 10:58 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I no be party delegate na! 

We can do what we can after candidates have emerged!

For now, senior men are having meetings and doing the permutations.

We can hope everything works in the best interest of Nigeria. 

I wish to see a Peter Obi Presidency and wish him well.
5/21/22, 10:59 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I doubt we will be shocked. It's either conscience or stomach infrastructure
5/21/22, 11:00 PM - +234 806 568 3004: You never know! Conscience may still swing the wind of politics in unimagined ways
5/21/22, 11:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Anyways... I talked about this strategy before

But I guess the decision to apply a different strategy comes from insight and belief

That is a process
5/21/22, 11:00 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The 980 delegates have to a greater extent the influence of their govs. Until Buhari signs the electoral act as ammended, Atiku's will pull some weight, but he knows he doesn't have them under his control and that is why he is campaigning seriously. It may be a fight to Finish between Obi and Atiku, but Obi will win. Obi needs the support of the pdp governora
5/21/22, 11:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Okay

"The greatest insult that you can give a Christian is to tell him that Jesus (Yeshua) is not God. 

When you say that you are denying the very essence of His being and equating Him to man. 

This is a red line for us but it is crossed every day yet we take it in our stride.

We do not kill or threaten to kill because of it and neither do we show our pain when others deny Him.

That does not mean that your lack of understanding of our faith or your denial of our beliefs does not hurt us. I assure you that it does. 

To the Christian, Jesus is not a Prophet but the second leg of the Holy Trinity of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. 

He is God incarnate that came down in the flesh and He is the Lamb of God that came to take away the sins of the world. 

He is the rock of our salvation, our provider and our strong defender. He is our Shield, our glory and the lifter of our Heads. 

We adore Him, we worship Him, we love Him more than life itself and we regard Him as our EVERYTHING.

To us He is far more than a mortal and it is to Him that we pray and make our supplications every day.

I will never shy away from saying this and I would rather die than deny His grace, love, mercy, compassion and DEITY.  

He alone gives us courage, He alone gives us life, He alone gives us hope and to Him alone do we go when our work on earth is done. 

He is the Blood of the Sprinkling, the El Shaddai, the Adonai, the Elohim and the I AM, THAT I AM. 

He is the Rose of Sharon, the Lily of the Valley and the Man of War. 

He is the Ancient of Days, the Lord of Hosts and the Prince of Peace. 

His power, His glory and His majesty stretches through the ages and into eternity. 

He is the Lord of creation and the Master of the Universe who knows the end even before the beginning. 

He is the Alpha and the Omega: the beginning and the end, to whom the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the waters, the fires, the winds, the elemental forces and the whole of creation bow. 

He is Jehova Elyon who sits above the circles of the earth, who holds the universe together by the power of His word, who gives life and who kills and who is filled with mercy, love and compassion. 

He is Yeshua Hamashiach who favours the bold, who provides for the poor and who is husband to the widow and father to the fatherless. 

He is Jehova El Gibbor who gives blessings, mercy, favour, power and honor to whom He deems fit, who rules in the affairs of men and who forges the destiny of nations. 

He is Yeshua El Parazim who gave His life as a living sacrifice, who paid for our sins, who conquered death, who rose again and whose train fills the Temple.

He is the Holy One of Israel before whom the Angels, the Archangels and the 24 Elders cry HOLY, HOLY HOLY!  

He ALONE is God, none can deny Him and none can stand beside Him."

On the flip side, delegates right now will determine if Obi becomes president, and they all have a mind of their own. They will split the votes according to the candidates they believe will bring them of this current quagmire. 

If they do not consider their children unborn and do not look beyond the monies ( which I'm my opinion is theirs in the first place), then they should be ready to go round this cycle again. Atiku is not our saviour. He is they for his selfish interests and not for our children. PO is frugal, not noisey( he can get the job done quietly), he will ensure we produce our full potential rather than import and consume. He will save for the rainy day rather than borrow and mortgage the future of our kids. He will win and He is PDP best candidate. If PDP wants to win this election, then Peter Obi not Atiku is their best signing for the electoral season.
Over 800 delegates will decide and it will be suicidal for PDP to go for a concensus in Atiku. Even if Mr  Obi is the 'supposed ' concensus for equity, let him slug it out with the other contestants and test his popularity and acceptability.

I agree with Bulus that Religion plays a part and that is why we cannot have another Muslim as president or a Muslim-Muslim ticket.

5/24/22, 9:26 AM - +234 703 714 8734: CHRISTIANITY DIDN'T COME TO AFRICA BY THE WHITEMAN. 
Often times when I hear people call Christianity THE RELIGION OF THE WHITEMAN I laugh at their gross display of ignorance. The one that baffles me the most is when they try to suggest THAT CHRIST WAS FORCED ON AFRICA THROUGH SLAVERY! That's not true. History actually has the true fact that 45% percent of Africa already knew about Jesus before the era of slavery.
Let me give you a shocker, the man that helped Jesus carry the cross on his road to Golgotha was an African and his name was Simon the Cyrene. Cyrene is located in Northern Africa in the place we now know as modern LIBYA! When the Apostles of Jesus began their ministry, Philip the Apostle introduced Jesus Christ to a high Ethiopian official (Ethiopian Eunuch). This happened  before the slavery era around AD 341 which was calculated to be approximately 1278 years before slavery. EZANA, the Ethiopian King at the time, after the Ethiopian Eunuch introduced Jesus to him officially named Ethiopia a Christian nation and from that time many countries and regions in Africa received the message of the Lord Jesus. Africans had the bible before the Europeans came. In fact the bible that came to Africa from Ethiopia is today named THE WORLD'S MOST COMPLETE BIBLE. 
To those who continue to walk in the ignorance of believing that Jesus was "forced" on Africa this is the time to debunk those fable tales and go back to painstaking studies. Study the real facts rather than feeding your non-belief systems with lies that are based on the opinions of another man.

A short explanation of why Peter Obi is in government
5/25/22, 10:21 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Don't be quick to assume it's IPOB, this thing has morphed into several other things

Core IPOB aren't involved in this, but every type or radicalism, cultism in and of itself, by it's nature is a lack or order, and would always spiral out of control.

There's people exploiting this that aren't IPOB
5/25/22, 10:32 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Tor

5/25/22, 10:44 AM - +234 806 092 4290: When groups that take laws into their hands like that exist, there's bound to arise subgroups that will further take the laws into their hands and use the platform to terrorise the community. All they need is a platform

5/25/22, 10:45 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We know how BH started
5/25/22, 10:48 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yeah
That's why it's important the country needs to end the exclusion
5/25/22, 10:53 AM - +234 806 092 4290: For me, I am afraid, IPOB is likely to create problems for Peter Obi, than BH. We already know BH are confirmed terrorists and he has to find a way of tackling them with use of force and diplomacy. How is he going to tackle IPOB that deny being Nigerians? Will they accept him as their president?
5/25/22, 10:56 AM - +234 806 566 2895: See eh

If Peter Obi wins, it will take the wind out of IPOB sails. Because the message dies. The message was political exclusion, what does MNK preach after that? Especially if Peter Obi succeeds
5/25/22, 10:59 AM - +234 806 566 2895: IPOB may be like BH but the message differs significantly and makes IPOB easier to dialogue with

If Peter Obi wins and the country works, no one, I repeat no one Igbo person will think about Biafra

5/25/22, 12:34 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The modus operandi of a terrorist organisation is to accept claims to acts of terror

That is how terrorists operate

This organisation has repeatedly denied these acts of terror


But our security outfit which us complicit in these acts are deliberately silent
5/25/22, 1:06 PM - +234 803 281 3842: IPOB has been fragmentalized in their strategy of operations since MNK's arrest. There are different "groups" within the group who do not agree on how the group should proceed. Some believe that civil disobedience is the way to go, others are pursuing means within the local and international legal systems and still others have taken to full-blown terrorism.  Ofcourse,the faced IPOB members still hold on to 1st and 2nd modus of operations but the "new",unknown folks with guns are still offshoots of the movement. Its sadly inevitable that a movement can take on new perspectives, especially when the patrons are unavailable to audit actions and plans within the group. While MNK's incarceration may be fingered as the cause of this new turn amongs some offshoots of IPOB, I also know that MNK sowed the seed of tribal hatred that has metamorphosed into this new terror. What I do not agree with is the notion that this new terror network are unassociated to the IPOB agenda because some member,whose identity and association with IPOB is in public domain,says so. What else would he say? Or you want "known" members to take responsibility for the actions of "unknown " gunmen?
5/25/22, 1:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: https://twitter.com/Chude__/status/1492101695924539414?t=6pW1OmgPiUjBypoIZLuQWQ&s=08
5/25/22, 2:11 PM - +234 806 092 4290: If they can fish these "unknown groups" out then we will take them serious that they are ready to defend their community. One thing we must know is that there is IPOB and there is ESN. IPOB is just a group of agitators and almost every Igbo person is a member of IPOB directly or indirectly, but ESN are a group of jobless civilians who have been recruited and armed to "kill and destroy", albeit in defence of the community. What happens to this group when the funding for them is no longer available or sustainable? What are they going to leave on? How do they react to the incarceration of their leader?
5/25/22, 3:22 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Omale you're a public health practitioner, you shouldn't make categorical statements like "almost every Igbo person is a member of IPOB, directly or indirectly"

Where's your data, reference material supporting such assertions?🤷🏿‍♂️

You can say Igbo people sympathize with them and even then it's not even close to half of the people I have been in contact with. 

The fact is that IPOB is a separatist group, and what is the fundamental problem? They feel excluded. But you think the solution is for them to fight crime?😅

See, the solution is simple. If the nation decides not to allow secession, then it must make deliberate steps towards reconciliation.
DIALOGUE!
Then request IPOB to fish out the miscreants but I tell you now... there's some other agenda in play in creating ethnic violence and heating up the polity
5/25/22, 3:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The government should do it's work and crackdown on crime but if BH is anything to go by, they will still fail
5/25/22, 4:03 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I agree with your submission, and hope that will be the case
5/25/22, 4:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The problem is the government is terribly partisan and frankly inept at tackling such issues

There's a dimension that requires show of force, but it also requires financial commitment on the part of the government to equip the security forces. 

There's another dimension that requires dialogue, which is a long term solution, but if you must prevent radicalization of more people, then you must dialogue and take deliberate steps towards inclusion. The weird part is that this thing is so simple.

Right now if they zoned presidential election to the south east in the major parties, that would have stolen the thunder from the separatists. Imagine how much fire you give to IPOB if the best presidential aspirant is from the region that's agitating and you muscle him out for inferior aspirants?
It's gasoline on already lit fire. 

Alas! The country has no foresight or insight into the possible outcome of currently minimal agitation.

Let me also add that in my experience from frequent communication and living in the East is this, Igbos no send IPOB. Would they want to secede? Yes, who doesn't at this point? Even middle belt

To a large extent Igbos look at IPOB as noisemakers but also realize they are correct about some things but most except the poor disagree with their strategies. However, Igbos are largely in agreement that naija isn't progressing and exiting is preferable to staying
5/25/22, 4:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You know these things very well👏🏼
5/25/22, 4:27 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Very true. We hope to get it right. At this point any meaningful Nigeria should support progress before we reach a breaking point which is bloody
5/25/22, 4:32 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

Boko Haram couldn't be easily curtailed because religious beliefs are hard to fight. I mean, how to reach someone who says no to formal education?

IPOB says Igbos are excluded and most objective persons must admit, that's certainly true to a degree. When Niger Delta militants were troubling the waterways and south south, the solution was dialogue. Use of force actually failed.

Why aren't we doing the same now? Because of a certain ethnocentric leader

It's on his Twitter handle
5/25/22, 6:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If PDP can’t see her is their best chance then the earlier he moves the better
5/25/22, 6:07 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If this is true, From the contents, he talked about another 'route'.  He may have activated plan B. June 3 deadline is near for All political parties to wrap up their presidential Primaries. The earlier a new identity, the better.

It's so unfortunate, PDP lost a golden opportunity to get back to mainstream politics
5/25/22, 6:08 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: PDP just went into oblivion
5/25/22, 6:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If there was any chance of a 3rd force, this is the time to establish it

5/25/22, 6:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You gerrit. It’s obvious they do not have the good of the country at heart. They have allowed sentiments play out. It’s possible they tried to negotiate with Obi to offer the VP ticket again. I think it’s a wise decision Obi has taken
5/25/22, 6:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It’s a technical approach used in Human Resource in Fortune 500 companies

Then it is his visit to 10 downing Street that sealed it
5/25/22, 6:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: This can be the only reason he resigned 


Nothing else
5/25/22, 6:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While I believe the west has interest. I doubt this is it.
5/25/22, 6:19 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay

You think it's about the delegates?

Wike could have easily given him his own
5/25/22, 6:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think it’s about PDP scared to make a south East candidate it’s frontliner
5/25/22, 6:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The National working committees Reluctance to ab initio zone it following unwritten principles was already a body language
5/25/22, 6:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This was more of his private buisness I think. His has business interests in the UK. 

He talked about the  PM invite. I think it was for business reasons, though you may not rule out your fears. It's all in the video of the classic fm's interview I uploaded a few days ago
5/25/22, 6:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: General Abdusalams recent posturing also didn’t help matters
5/25/22, 6:27 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Yea he linked that visit to his business interest
5/25/22, 6:28 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Na politician na
5/25/22, 6:28 PM - +234 817 034 1232: He won't say it's because of politics...so as not to look like U.K influenced him
5/25/22, 6:29 PM - +234 817 034 1232: But I am still waiting for live video to accept he resigned
5/25/22, 6:30 PM - +234 817 034 1232: That letter and his handle...can still stand for plausible deniability in future 

Let him do an interview first
5/25/22, 6:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He needs to make it and carry his Nigerians along with the next line of action.

They are two politicians the cabals fear: Obi and Osinbanjo and it is those two we want to put there.
5/25/22, 6:31 PM - +234 817 034 1232: True

5/25/22, 6:33 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He used to be a king maker for peace. There is more to the General than meets the eye
5/25/22, 6:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Nooo it's about money and influence

Wike and Atiku. They know Obi is strong but can't shake the influence of the other two
5/25/22, 6:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
Sooooo on point
5/25/22, 6:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: His message is transformational, and any platform to serve would be welcomed. I don't think Obi needs PDP as PDP needed Obi. This are my thoughts anyway.

Don't forget Obi is though mentally, he was the first to go to court to get his mandate and set the tone for others to believe in the judiciary and fight their mandate. He was the rate limiting step to the Off season elections we have in Anambra, Osun, Ondo,etc. 

In fact he paved the way for Osibanjo to fight for the states in the west, OBJ and PDP had manipulated.

I'm impressed he never settled for VP or tow the line of manipulating the delegates with money.

If OBI gets another party's mandate, he will be the man to beat. PDP is currently weak, fragmented as an opposition party and missed an opportunity to bounce back.
5/25/22, 6:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Obi was PDPs selling point. With him out, interest in whatever they have to offer will mainly be to eat the money and move
5/25/22, 6:45 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Absolutely Vic!
5/25/22, 6:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: PDP wants Obi so they can accrue his organic followership and maybe buy more with the money bags from Atiku and Wike
5/25/22, 6:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Sadly he has understood this
5/25/22, 6:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And won’t bite the apple
5/25/22, 6:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It’s All or None
5/25/22, 6:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Atiku has run since 1996 or so and has not won. What makes them think this time it would be different
5/25/22, 6:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: True. All or none. No in-betweens
5/25/22, 6:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Wike is a joker and not fit for presidential roles
5/25/22, 6:50 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes. The emotional intelligence and temperament may be lacking. 

Though I like his bluntness and his ability to speak to power.
5/25/22, 6:53 PM - +234 703 714 8734: There is a possibility of running as an independent candidate, that my be the route
5/25/22, 6:54 PM - +234 703 714 8734: *that maybe

He's very tough, stubborn actually. I'm happy he didn't give in to the norm

The momentum shift if he goes to another party and wins will be something like nothing this country has even seen and will represent a new beginning

Remember I always said I preferred this option for him

For those who think this is the end, and considering nkwobi and coke combo, it might be the beginning of something sweet in the offing.

5/26/22, 9:34 AM - +234 810 006 7926: When a post mortem is carried out retrospectively, it would be said that the primary cause of death was listening to so called cabal and the secondary cause of death would be PO' s unfortunate exit. More painful would it be if he wins on another mandate. Reminds me of Obaseki of Edo state. Sometimes or most times, All you need is all you've got which is the people.

Never would any of the big parties listen to their cabals or God Father's again. The limit of their powers is to influence the party's candidate, but the people decide who is president. PO should tell us by today his next move, so the needful would be done.

Again the only 2 candidates the Cabals who have put the country in this mess are PO and YO. Those two must have their names on the ballot in this elections if we must break this chain. It would be easy, but it is possible. It will always seem impossible until it is done.

I didn't even mind them knowing that I drove from keffi to Lafia and will return same day for this all important document.  I did a new biometric to be sure that I can vote. 

Now I can vote and I'm of good cheer.

5/26/22, 8:51 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with giving her security personnel such amount. She should do more. The only thing I don't appreciate is the vidéo coverage
5/26/22, 8:53 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We foresaw these issues but una talk say Peter Obi go change the status quo. I still maintain that he should have retained his Vice Presidential ticket and then plan to take over just the way Osibanjo is trying to take over now. 

He said he wasn't desperate to be President but to see a better Nigeria. 

It may have been easier to change things fro the inside that to lose out totally.

Anything is still possible but his chances are now slimmer. And is he loses out in 2023, there is no guarantee that he will be accepted in either PDP or APC in 2027 so he will have to go back to square 1. 

A third force is possible but its not something you set up 9 months before the election. The best you may achieve is to come 3rd in the election. 

Fingers crossed!
5/26/22, 9:00 PM - +234 810 006 7926: How much is her husband's salary per month or her 'salary' that is enough to throw public funds around. So easy to throw money around you don't legitimately earn.

Condemnable. The First Lady is not even recognized by the constitution
5/26/22, 9:01 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Francis you didn't foresee anything I didn't, at least not in this regard. My point is that this was an outcome that any proper thinking person foresaw.

I can't recall if it was during one of our late night throwdowns that I said I prefer Peter Obi winning elsewhere. 

I'm surprised you're still touting this flawed argument that he should have been VP. To whom, Atiku and sully his name when that one starts stealing?
You need to understand that the way you're analyzing this is exactly what the system wants. I understand that as a politician it comes with the territory but that way of thinking is conformist and would never bring change

What you're asking of Peter Obi is what transactional politicians do? Why haven't you asked why Tinubu doesn't try his hands at VP? 

The fact is this, we all know nothing, we can only speculate. My point is this

1. Who is the best candidate? Is it Peter Obi?

2. What are the problems he faces in being elected?

3. How can we help with that problem?

It's really that simple. This is the approach to problems, not wallowing in pessimistic and cynicism
5/26/22, 9:03 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The fact of the matter is that we should stop asking exceptional candidates to be VP to poor candidates. There's no change that happens that way

What would be Peter Obi be able to do as VP, how much control would he have?
5/26/22, 9:04 PM - +234 806 566 2895: What guarantees are there that the country would take him as president after serving 8years if the government was bad?

Na there Osinbajo dey so. That's just bad advice
5/26/22, 9:04 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Politics is never simple my brother😊😊😊
5/26/22, 9:05 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This is why the wives of PO and YO( both humble and pious) are different. If as governor the first lady is doing this then, I wander what she would do if she becomes wife of a sitting president.
5/26/22, 9:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Eight years time Peter Obi would be 68 years, do you think he'd still want naija wahala
5/26/22, 9:07 PM - +234 806 568 3004: It is easier to disrupt the system from within than to lose out totally. That is just my point. I already see Peter Obi as the best candidate who never became President in 2023. Maybe in 2027 or 2031 if his popularity remains very high at that time (very unlikely though)

Time will tell any. June 3 is the first target and then in February 2023 we will know how the story ends!
5/26/22, 9:07 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Francis it seems you don't think PO can become president outside the PDP. This was the same scenario when the Uba's held sway in Anambra and he got his mandate through the courts with APGA. The South East was Pdp's strong hold at the time.

I hope you are ready for the storm
5/26/22, 9:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We know nothing, revolutions were despised when they started.

It simply began with one man with a belief that inspired others to believe.

A third party can wish, if you contribute, I contribute, we all contribute
5/26/22, 9:08 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Is Atiku the worst President we would never have?
5/26/22, 9:09 PM - +234 806 568 3004: You are correct. I dont see Peter Obi becoming President outside PDP. 

I may not be correct but that is just my own prediction at the moment.
5/26/22, 9:09 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Atiku cant be worse than Buhari. I am sure about that
5/26/22, 9:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We shall see

Your case is you're terribly pessimistic and it's keeping you from having the slimmest hope or doing anything about it

I rather know I did my all and failed than be haunted by the thought that maybe if I did something the outcome would be different. I guess that's just me
5/26/22, 9:11 PM - +234 806 568 3004: There can be no revolution until Nigerians unite beyond ethnic and religious boundaries. 

Forget what you see on Twitter bros. Peter Obi cant win in the north except there is no northern candidate in the race. His chances to do that have gotten slimmer now that he has left PDP
5/26/22, 9:11 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Francis has refused to study history😂, hence he can't draw parallels and history is replete with them

Francis there are several points in history like this, that's one reason why I believe
5/26/22, 9:11 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I am not pessimistic but realistic
5/26/22, 9:11 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Its politics and not magic. It is a game and the best player wins
5/26/22, 9:12 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't doubt his chances in some regards are slimmer but in some regards much much better
5/26/22, 9:12 PM - +234 806 566 2895: No you're not realistic. Else you'd know the limitations to what you know
5/26/22, 9:12 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The way EndSARS failed is the way the Peter Obi noise will likely fail. Except the North are with him
5/26/22, 9:13 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Much better to be third candidate in the race na
5/26/22, 9:13 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Twitter was what started ENDSARS, it's a microcosm of society, with effects that are hard to model. So no, it's important
5/26/22, 9:14 PM - +234 806 566 2895: And the north being with him is a matter of VP and who told some aren't already?
5/26/22, 9:14 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We know enough to have predicted he wont win the PDP primaries. He saw the handwriting on the wall and left. 

Na the same way we dey predict say bros go soon go back to face in business interest or keep his campaign alive foe 2027 or 2031
5/26/22, 9:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Hahaha

But it's the same thing I knew and I'm now all, "it's the end, the end"

Him leaving when he did was perfect. He has created awareness and let PDP looking bad for their actions.

In fact he has drummed more support for that, from what I have seen.
5/26/22, 9:18 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The end result is what matters bro.

In politics, it not he who makes the loudest noise that is celebrated. It is the person who wins the election. 

Peter Obi is the best candidate for the job. That is not in doubt. 

But you have to play the game through the system and that changes everything for him. 

He would only have won if the Presidency was zoned to the South East. Unfortunately, both parties seem to think otherwise. 

We may likely end up with a case of Atiku vs Tinubu.
5/26/22, 9:20 PM - +234 806 568 3004: He drummed more support to increase his popularity and affirm his integrity. 

But that more support will not give him the Presidency. If he surprises me then he comes as 1st runner up in the election
5/26/22, 9:21 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I'm glad you've admitted he is the best candidate

All your analysis you've not mentioned if you can do anything

Or you think you have nothing to do to influence the outcome?
5/26/22, 9:21 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We'll see won't we
5/26/22, 9:21 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Dem no dey change the system in 9 months bro
5/26/22, 9:22 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I agree we can do something but its not by sleeping until 1 year till the next election then we start talking about 3rd force
5/26/22, 9:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Do you think Atiku would win?. I don't think the governor's except Fintiri would support him.

The 12 million votes he got the last time was mainly from the South and the governor's have control of most of the over 800 delegates.

He paid each delegate at the time 10,000 USD. I hope they won't milk him. I'm sure he can get the delegates from the North West but not other parts.

Don't forget, his Age, his antecedents with corruption tag, his loyalty to pdp( left when the party was at it low ebb), his religious blunder with his tweet, and his foot shoulders loosing out in the ongoing elections don't seem to augur well for him and serial attempts at the office shows desperation rather than a man who is ready to serve 

Woke, Saraki and Udom seem to be the spoilers. Don't be surprised if one of the emerges at pdp's flag bearer.

Pdp missed a golden opportunity. I hope they can recover from this. If they loose out, and a third force becomes the major party like APC did in 2015, the remaining PDP governor's may decamp
5/26/22, 9:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You Francis, I mean you not anyone else

What can you do now, or isn't there anything to do?
5/26/22, 9:24 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Did you hear Wike on Channels Politics today. 

If Obi knew PDP as he should have he should have left immediately after the 2019 elections and started building the 3rd force. Not to stay in PDP and expect magic. 

Expect that delegates will leave dollars and listen to his sweet words🤣🤣🤣🤣

Is it not the same messed up PDP system that will produce the delegates. What was he thinking? That party delegates will be elected on Twitter
5/26/22, 9:25 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Now its too late for me or you to do anything.
5/26/22, 9:26 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We can help Peter Obi emerge as a runner up. His only chance was to win the PDP ticket and not be up against a northern candidate. 

Now, there is nothing we can do for him that to make sure that the margin of defeat is not 'too embarrassing'
5/26/22, 9:27 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Omo!! I don’t know at what point to enter this WWE ring again sef!! Lemme just hand Rowland Folded chair.....
5/26/22, 9:27 PM - +234 806 568 3004: For now, its too late. Elections are in February and we have just 1 weeks before June 3. 

It is Politics. Its not magic bro
5/26/22, 9:27 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/26/22, 9:28 PM - +234 806 568 3004: All we can to to help Bro Peter Obi is to minimize the loss by giving him a few million votes to emerge as 1st or 2nd Runner up
5/26/22, 9:29 PM - +234 810 006 7926: *soldiers
5/26/22, 9:29 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You maybe, not me

But let me ask you, what would you do if you had the time?
5/26/22, 9:30 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We can help ourselves. You sound like you pity him😂

Omo! You know who to pity
5/26/22, 9:30 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The only way he can win the election at this point is if all the other parties bring candidates from the South East. I don't even see Peter Obi defeating Osibanjo or Tinubu now that he is not on the PDP platform. A northern candidate further complicated the equation. l
5/26/22, 9:30 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You still don't get that it's not him you're helping.
5/26/22, 9:31 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Imagine if this Peter Obi movement started and was sustained since 2019.
5/26/22, 9:31 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Nobody enters an election to lose so I feel bad for his likely loss. I belive he is the best candidate and has good intentions
5/26/22, 9:33 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The Nigeria is for all of us. I know that. 

But its politics bro.

We need to begin to organize for 2031
5/26/22, 9:33 PM - +234 806 568 3004: So that someone with sense can be President
5/26/22, 9:33 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Oga Francis is the only nigerian in diaspora who is not supporting PO for the nigeria we never had. This is a Save Nigeria Movement. We must suspend politics for now, cos complaining and protesting has not helped us. This is our rare opportunity to set the stage for greatness for nigeria and this deserves all sincere patriotic prayers
5/26/22, 9:34 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I am supporting Peter Obi but I being realistic. 

Politics is about wining and not about just supporting
5/26/22, 9:34 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Peter Obi can win now that he has left the PDP
5/26/22, 9:34 PM - +234 703 714 8734: 🙏
5/26/22, 9:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Francis you're just espousing fantasies

You see, I have seen this your approach several times. If I had come to you in 2019, you'd say forget it Peter Obi can never be president

But now since you have the benefit of the past you can claim it and say we started late

You approach is lazy😅

What do we do now? Critical thinking here

But four years down the line oga will if we had started this in 2023😅
5/26/22, 9:36 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Wike is not willing to back down for anybody, Atiku will not even come second in the Primaries, PO has no chance in the PDP
5/26/22, 9:36 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I had some hope for him previously but was worried about his chances of winning the PDP primaries. 

But now that he has read the handwriting on the wall and exited the party, I think he is out of the main race.

I may be wrong and will be glad if he wins the election but this game is not going to be won be a 3rd force that was set up 1 week to INEC deadline
5/26/22, 9:37 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Your issue and your apathy is driven by your risk perception and assessment of where the country is and would be

This country would not in the shape for you to be saying this in 2031

You think this election is just another election baba you need to understand our economic situation
5/26/22, 9:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: If we show you that person, pessimism wont allow you believe the person can ever be anything
5/26/22, 9:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: He meant can't, no clap
5/26/22, 9:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂
5/26/22, 9:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Wike will likely win and lose later
5/26/22, 9:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Bigger things have happened
5/26/22, 9:39 PM - +234 806 568 3004: If you had come to me in 2019, I will tell you it is hard but not impossible. 

Then I will tell you what Peter Obi needs to do to be a formidable 3rd force for the next election. 

If he can do it then maybe the story would be different. 

Another truth about politics is that nothing is guaranteed which is what Politicians must always be optimistic even in the face of likely failure. 

Sometimes, the game changes - But such change is also predictable. 

It is unlikely that the 2023 game will change in favour of Peter Obi
5/26/22, 9:41 PM - +234 703 714 8734: A 3rd force is a possible win, last minute mergers, kwankwaso has structures, APGA has structures, a 3rd force is a merger of structures, not a creation of new structures. SDP and LP also has some structures in the south west. And when the Primaries in PDP and APC is over and the dollar are spent, men will fall back to their true conscience , all we need is PO on the ballot
5/26/22, 9:41 PM - +234 806 568 3004: There is work to be done to be President of Nigeria. It is not a job that can be done in One year. 

Remember, the days of godfatherism and ballot-box stuffing are gradually going away
5/26/22, 9:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Not true

You will say exactly the same thing, the past has given you deniability

You need to SEE to BELIEVE

That goes for most people who will remain most people
5/26/22, 9:42 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think Francis is plotting the usual permutations and that continues to fuel his pessimism
5/26/22, 9:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂
It's that simple
5/26/22, 9:43 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I totally understand you Francis. And while I respect the despicable role of the Cabal that has held sway, I also want to recognize the strength of the frustration that today’s Nigerians feel
5/26/22, 9:43 PM - +234 806 566 2895: He doesn't even understand that this is how politicians have conditioned him to think
5/26/22, 9:43 PM - +234 806 568 3004: It wont argue. Anything is possible in politics. 

But there are several preconditions. 

Kwankwaso accepting to be VP and then then PDP and APC not fielding a candidate from the north. 

Time will tell.
5/26/22, 9:43 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Interestingly between these two groups, the PVC lies with the second party
5/26/22, 9:43 PM - +234 703 714 8734: We have a new electoral bill, (thanks to Buhari) that has strengthened the ballot. PO 2023 is possible, cos votes will count now more than ever
5/26/22, 9:44 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Let them field northern candidate, you'd split the north and win the south
5/26/22, 9:44 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Toh
5/26/22, 9:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You @2348065683004 are a scientist and can at least insert some data to draw these conclusions outside of the old rhetorics
5/26/22, 9:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Nations evolve because people become enlightened and paradigms shift
5/26/22, 9:45 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I pray your Optimism works for Nigeria. The country needs Peter Obi now but you can not come and play basketball in a football court
5/26/22, 9:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: First the assumption Peter Obi cannot win outside PDP and APC is one you must know I have largely held myself. Recall I even went as far as promising Rowland some money if that happened
5/26/22, 9:46 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 👍🏿
5/26/22, 9:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I was hoping to lose actually.
5/26/22, 9:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: But the permutations of the past hve changed largely
5/26/22, 9:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Omo I don go work. I don tire to type. 

Francis, my advice is that think about what idealogy and process of thought benefits politicians. 

See if that's in agreement with how you see this issue

Then think about what how they wouldn't want you thinking and seeing things
5/26/22, 9:46 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Which South. Those PDP and APC men understand this game. Why do you think everyone wants to wait for the other to choose candidate
5/26/22, 9:47 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Recall that when we talked about numbers to sway elections we always looked to the north as the biggest share
5/26/22, 9:47 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: But if you look at election trends in the past you would recall that the winner largely won with maybe just under 16m in a population of over 80m registered voters
5/26/22, 9:48 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: As at 2019, 56% of voters fell between the ages of 18-35.... the youths
5/26/22, 9:48 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The largest geopolitical zone that will sway this election will be the youths
5/26/22, 9:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't even want to dabble into this till I see INEC data on registered voters
5/26/22, 9:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Previously reluctant, fence sitters
5/26/22, 9:49 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The youths that couldnt not collectively push for EndSARs across the country abi. Until you have a candidate that can get the youths in the North then this assumption will fall like a pack of cards
5/26/22, 9:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Over the last 3-4 elections we have seen voter population drop from 51% to 47% and down to about 35% in the last election... I may just be a few marks from the actual valid data
5/26/22, 9:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If the recent registration drives are anything to go by
5/26/22, 9:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: That proportion of registered voters who eventually vote should shoot up.
5/26/22, 9:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: POs followership is already organic
5/26/22, 9:50 PM - +234 806 568 3004: There will be more voters in this election. But the question is will they be voting based on ideology/personality or based on ethnoreligious sentiments
5/26/22, 9:51 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There is yet that followership that won’t come out publicly
5/26/22, 9:51 PM - +234 806 568 3004: No comment. make we not argue too much. Senior men will decide what happens by June 3rd and we will see what happens by February 2023
5/26/22, 10:03 PM - +234 806 965 1788: THE CRUX OF THE NIGERIAN MATTER AND PETER OBI

Way back in 2002, a certain student of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria was chanting ‘SAI BABA’
This slogan became synonymous with competence, transparency accountability and all other divine attributes of great leadership. As far as this student is concerned.

That student was me.

You could not tell me there was any Nigerian worthy of even comparison with Buhari. I just wouldn’t listen. 

I based my belief solely on his antecedents in PTF under Abacha and the stories we heard of his incorruptibility and his jailing of corrupt politicians during his military rule.

As a young man, it was anything to rub it in the corruption-laden faces of our then leaders under Obasanjo.

Buhari was labeled a religious bigot, an ethnic leader and a regional hypocrite. We stood by and blamed the established order and establishment for all his shortcomings.

He lost elections, resigned the party and formed his own, lost more elections until a certain Tinubu et al decided to extinguish a GEJ.

In 2015, it became apparent to our neonatal political experience that no single region, ethnicity or religion can deliver electoral mandate no matter the competency and attributes on the table- a lesson already known by the political class.

Fast forward to yesterday’s resignation of Peter Obi from the PDP. I saw it coming, most people saw it coming, he saw it coming and even his supporters saw it coming. 

Don’t get me wrong, Peter Obi is a gentleman, no doubt he possesses the qualities related by his supporters and maybe even more. But he is just not ready for the landmine-laden fields of the Nigerian electoral process.

His resignation comfirmed two things to me;

1. He knows he will not clinch the PDP ticket, a ticket he knows is key to not just his ambition but that of the South East.

2. The Nigerian system cannot be changed overnight.

Facts I already knew.

He has a choice to make now, be part of a third force that may deny PDP and/or APC electoral victory or stand alone and continue to build his brand and name.

Whatever choice he makes, I’d like to think the following corrections will be noted by his campaign, his supporters and the entire South East

1. It’s not enough to have competence on your side or to have a gentleman on the ballot.

2. Building alliances and bridges across regions, religions and tribes is essential and central to electoral victory at whatever level. Choosing not to do so also has its perks in Nigeria.

3. Spewing hate from supporters only serves to paint the candidate bad and tarnish his image. I was a Buhari supporter, I know this all too well.

4. Do not give your candidate a regional, ethnic or religious colorations. Shouting it’s the turn of the South East doesn’t mean it must happen. You must work towards it. This is politics, not draft.

5. The electoral process is not in the media and /or social media. It plays a role but it is mainly on ground.

6. Money is involved, small or large, it is very much involved.

7. Never make your idea about a single person, it must be a movement about the idea and not the person. PDP won four Presidential elections without Peter Obi near the ballot and lost two with him near it.

8. Having a bank of supporters is good but more important is having people who have structured loyalty believeing in your cause. Godfathers are unavoidable and you must have one. Who is his Godfather in the South East. In fact, who is a Godfather in the South East.

9. You must get power first, before you can share it.

10. You don’t know it all. Especially in a cosmopolitan, multi-nationality Nation like Nigeria.

I have had course to interact and align with people from the South East over the last 20 years in student unionism, professional politics and secular/partisan politics and I can tell you I have found them honest, reliable and intellectually blessed. 

I would not trade their brotherhood and loyalty for all the gold and silver. They have supported me personally, professionally and politically beyond measure.

As for Peter Obi, he has a whole lot of work to do if he wants to actualize his very articulate competent intent.

In my small experience, you can be the most qualified and still loose elections. It happens everywhere, no matter the loafty ideals you hold.

5/26/22, 10:47 PM - +234 817 950 7218: For me it's pretty obvious.

Peter Obi will not emerge as president in 2023. 

It's theoretically possible but it's not practically possible.

We need to simply watch what PDP and APC field and if there is a reasonable candidate it's probably best to caste votes for that person

If they field 2 quacks like the last election then we should all rally and campaign for Peter Obi to help him achieve a reasonable 2nd runner up position.

That will be a strong enough statement moving forward towards the next election

I said the same thing in 2019. Nigerians need to openly reject mediocrity and make a statement to the political class that chaff is recognized as chaff

But we aren't in lala land

We are in the real world

5/27/22, 7:30 AM - +234 806 566 2895: GANG UP AGAINST PETER OBI:

Many of us were not aware, that as at last week. Amaechi and Atiku, ganged up to Arrest PETER OBI, using EFCC just to RUBBISH his name and ensure a smooth ride for them in APC & PDP at the General elections 🗳 

The EFCC boys, were sent to dig out the listing of UK 🇬🇧 houses 🏡 and bring out PETER OBI’s name on the house he owns in LONDON, which worths £1 MILLION.
They have perfected all the court documents to arraign him in court for CORRUPTION and looting ANAMBRA state fund to acquire property in UK 🇬🇧 

Unfortunately for these gang of criminals, PETER OBI is actually carrying copies of documents of his assets all the time.
The house was bought in 1996. That was, 3 good years before the current civilian rule and 7 clear years before Peter Obi became governor of Anambra state.
PETER OBI rubbished the EFCC chairman that came with his boys to AREEST him.

These were part of the GANG UP Peter Obi mentioned in an interview last week.

The time has come for NIGERIANS to take over this country from these group of criminals that has taken over this nation since 1999.
If we fail to do it now, then we are doomed forever.

The name of the political party is PETER OBI.
The time, is NOW!!!!

🤣🤣

Are you shocked or you got mixed signals
5/28/22, 12:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: In 2001, Prof ABC Nwosu was approached by some power brokers to contest for Governorship of Anambra state in 2003.

He turned them down, citing his age. 

He said he would be 60 years old in 2003 and won't be able to govern a difficult state like Anambra effectively at that age.

He advised them to approach a younger and successful person.

The powerbrokers asked him to recommend three young men who can do the job. 

Soon after then, Mr Peter Obi, the 40 year old Chairman of Fidelity bank was invited to a dinner by Prof Nwosu.

As a banker, he went with the hopes of getting a bank deposit.

But rather, he found himself sharing his views about Nigeria, the economy, governance and business with the Professor.

Nothing political was discussed. 

Four months later, the powerbrokers returned to get the names of the three brilliant young potential governorship candidates from Prof Nwosu.

Prof Nwosu said, "The first name on my list is Peter Obi, the second is Peter Obi and the third is Peter Obi. Go and look for him!"

Armed with the recommendation, the power brokers raced to the young man. 

"You come highly recommended. We want you to run for the governorship of Anambra in 2003"

Peter Obi exclaimed, "Over my dead body.

He said, "I am 40 years old, I am Chairman of a bank: the largest shareholder in the bank. I have interests in three banks, I sit on the board of several companies. Every weekend I fly first class to London for relaxation. I am enjoying my life. Why do you think I would want to get involved in this politics madness?"

"We need a man of your experience to rescue Anambra state" They said to him. 

"I will give you feedback" He said.

Shortly after, Peter Obi travelled to USA for a 6 week course at Keller Graduate school of Management, Chicago.

The course was on "The Global economy" and  taught by Professor Jacob, the founder of the Institution.

A $40,000 course that had top business leaders from around the world as students.

After about a month, Peter Obi asked a question in class, "Why is nothing being said about Africa in this course?" He questioned the Professor.

"There is nothing like African economy. Nobody plans for Africa. Can you give me 10-20 years plan for your country?" Professor Jacob asked and Invited Peter Obi to lunch.

After lunch, they took a walk along Lake Michigan and talked about the preference of Nigerians for the dollar over the Naira, the exchange rate, the lack of economic plans and lack of faith in Nigeria.

Then the Prof said to Peter Obi,

"Go back to your country and participate in building public wealth. Public wealth enriches everybody, individual wealth impoverishes every body. All of you want to make private money but it does not enrich the people!"

The statement hit Peter Obi and the offer of governorship suddenly flashed though his mind. 

He made the decision.

And the rest is history. 

*PS:Peter Obi left behind 71 billion Naira in the treasury of Anambra State at the end of his second term in 2014*

Lessons:
-If you demonstrate competence and are successful in your field, when there's a need for competent hands in a higher office or situation, you will be called upon.

-The position others are fighting to get would be yours to refuse when your time comes.

-You need to know certain people who have enough faith in you to mention your name in the right places and recommend you for top jobs.

5/28/22, 11:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Makes it even more easier for the youths to vote Peter Obi.
5/28/22, 11:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Nigerians will not likely vote across party lines this time. The delegates have done well, with 20,000 USD they sold their soul. Let's see how much Atiku has stolen will buy  majority of Nigerians
5/28/22, 11:48 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Of course we are not stopping them from voting Obi.

Their voting Obi is not stopping Atiku from being the next President.  His problem will be the APC candidate and definitely not Peter Obi.

The youths can give Peter Obi 3-5 million votes. Significant to come as 2nd runner up but definitely not enough to get him the Presidency
5/28/22, 11:51 PM - +234 806 568 3004: You really believe in Nigerians.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Nigerians that the Politicians will divide with religion and ethnicity.

The small proportion not moved will be bought over because there is hunger in the land!.

You need to be sure about the "Nigerian" you are relying on to chang the status quo
5/28/22, 11:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: So you envisage Bola Tinubu and Atiku slugging it out, and fearing BAT will win?.

May it not come to pass
5/28/22, 11:53 PM - +234 806 965 1788: It's likely BAT vs ATIKU final

5/28/22, 11:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Buhari cannot give BAT

5/28/22, 11:54 PM - +234 806 965 1788: He doesn't have an option

5/28/22, 11:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He does. BAT is bad market, same for Atiku. Unfortunately both parties appear confused to me.
5/28/22, 11:55 PM - +234 806 537 0692: I don't see any surprises with PDP primaries ... What were you expecting before?
5/28/22, 11:55 PM - +234 806 568 3004: If the 3rd force is strong enough, they can cause a significant split in the opposition vote and help APC win the election
5/28/22, 11:56 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 👍
5/28/22, 11:56 PM - +234 806 537 0692: And it won't be any different from APC primaries too
5/28/22, 11:56 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Both parties given the primaries to the highest bidder
5/28/22, 11:56 PM - +234 806 568 3004: BAT will bring bullion van of dollars😝😝😝😝
5/28/22, 11:57 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Yes bit remember also that kwankwaso may split the votes for the APC in the North

5/28/22, 11:57 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Life long ambition about to become a real

#Jagaban
5/28/22, 11:58 PM - +234 810 006 7926: APC was a 3rd force before 2015. Nobody new APC( four ACN states plus 1 CPC state governors). So never underestimate LP.

Yemi Osinbanjo is likely to win the APC ticket
5/28/22, 11:58 PM - +234 806 965 1788: I hope he won step down for BAT at the 11th hour
5/28/22, 11:59 PM - +234 806 568 3004: LP may have pulled weight with a northern candidate. Not Peter Obi.

The youths will give him 3-5 million votes and he was wait to try again in 2027
5/29/22, 12:00 AM - +234 806 537 0692: In which Country???
5/29/22, 12:00 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Very unlikely. BAT may be compelled to step down. If the party must salvage herself and win Atiku who is seen to be a thief, then Buhari will bring someone with perceived integrity to win the elections for APC. Integrity will be the selling point for ApC and LP
5/29/22, 12:01 AM - +234 810 006 7926: If only wishes were horses
5/29/22, 12:02 AM - +234 806 965 1788: We will await the outcome then
5/29/22, 12:04 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Don't forget, the 12 million votes Atiku got was mainly from SS, SE and NC. They are not likely to vote along that liner this time. The north won't vote with one voice this time( don't forget Atiku does not have a cult following in the north like Buhari and kwankwaso will split the votes)
5/29/22, 12:04 AM - +234 806 568 3004: How has integrity helped anyone.

People votes Buhari partly on the basis of integrity,
What did they get? 

Shebi they have all left APC and apologized to Nigerian for the misleading presumption about integrity🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/29/22, 12:05 AM - +234 810 006 7926: It will count this time if the person PDP is bringing is perceived to be corrupt
5/29/22, 12:06 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The north won't vote with one voice abi.

No comment! Just check the past. Use the past to predict the future👍👍👍

We will see after the elections.
5/29/22, 12:06 AM - +234 810 006 7926: God will help us. Even we ourselves don't believe that we are that change we want
5/29/22, 12:07 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Okay.
5/29/22, 12:07 AM - +234 703 714 8734: APC plans to adopt Jonathan as consensus, Jonathan maybe their brighter chance against Atiku compared to BAT
5/29/22, 12:08 AM - +234 810 006 7926: The past and the future can only be different by what we do know
5/29/22, 12:08 AM - +234 806 568 3004: How many Nigerian politicians are not corrupt.

Bros, leave that integrity issue.

Peter Obi is unique but unfortunately can't win this particular election.

He should remind relevant until the Presidency is zoned to SE. 

Only then can Peter become President
5/29/22, 12:09 AM - +234 806 568 3004: We can start planning for 2027.

To late to change the course of tins for 2023.

It's either PDP or APC
5/29/22, 12:10 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Wike messed up, he had a chance to make PDP zone to southeast, but he kicked it for his selfish agenda. He missed the opportunity to stand for fairness and justice
5/29/22, 12:10 AM - +234 806 568 3004: That I won't argue but will be a hard sell.

The core north will prefer Atiku to Jonathan
5/29/22, 12:11 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Core south believe it is their slot to be president
5/29/22, 12:11 AM - +234 806 568 3004: He may not have succeeded but he should have tried.

Maybe he saw the SE zoning won't work so didn't want to get into a tight corner😊
5/29/22, 12:11 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Jonathan is baggage. He will be taken to court( the current court ruling will be appealed), APC can risk it. The cabals have tried to package him to president BUhari , with the hope that the north will get back power in 4 years.

Buhari never liked what happened in Rivers, Zamfara and Bayelsa.

Jonathan has legal baggage and may be difficult to sell, though Buhari may not mind
5/29/22, 12:11 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Core south🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/29/22, 12:12 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Who are they
5/29/22, 12:12 AM - +234 706 647 6470: <Media omitted>
5/29/22, 12:12 AM - +234 806 965 1788: He was busy buying delegates instead of aspirants 😀😀😀
5/29/22, 12:12 AM - +234 806 568 3004: You still think it's this man that is running the country abi🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/29/22, 12:12 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/29/22, 12:13 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I don't think so. Tambuwal stepping down added to Atiku's votes. Atiku wouldn't have not have won if Tambuwal and Sa
5/29/22, 12:14 AM - +234 703 714 8734: True, even udom didn't stepdown for him, he is just a learner
5/29/22, 12:15 AM - +234 810 006 7926: PO and Yemi Osinbanjo are the clean ones in the pack
5/29/22, 12:15 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Atiku would have still won but with very narrow margin.

They didn't want to risk that so tambuwal played his card
5/29/22, 12:17 AM - +234 703 714 8734: If he (wike) ends up on a ticket with Atiku, Atiku will make sure he end his political career after their tenor
5/29/22, 12:17 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Not likely. Tambuwal had the most of delegates from the NW, which was significant. Subtract about 150 votes from Atiku and you would understand what I mean. 

Atiku had to get by All means Tambuwal to step down, it was the only way he could beat Wike
5/29/22, 12:18 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Yemi will not even smell the ticket
5/29/22, 12:18 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Consensus favours Jonathan, delegate votes favours BAT
5/29/22, 12:19 AM - +234 810 006 7926: How many of Tinubu's men or boys won the recent governorship, senate or House of reps APC Elections?
5/29/22, 12:20 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Yemi is already packing his bags to leave the villa

The game is for senior men😝😝😝😝

a🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/29/22, 12:20 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Is it Kano, that is divided, or Lagos that has 60 delegates instead of 360 hoped by BAT that wants to win?
5/29/22, 12:21 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Tambuwal sold out Wike, but Wike should have pallied with aspirants, not fight them all
5/29/22, 12:22 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Wike was just a joke ...
5/29/22, 12:24 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Wike attacked Atiku, Tambuwal and Saraki in one statement, that they sold out PDP to bring in Buhari to suffer nigerians, that statement place Atiku, Tambuwal and Saraki in the same basket, and they had to fight together for survival
5/29/22, 12:25 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Which NW .... Tambuwal that narrowly won his second tenure in office as Governor?

Maybe we need to give you gist of Tambuwal at home level ..
5/29/22, 12:25 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Even BAT knows he cannot win. He knows he would have to wait another 16 years before it gets to his turn and then he would be too old. That is why BAT is so desperate to win and Atiku( if he doesn't win now, he would be 83 years when he will be  contesting next).

But no matter how they shave their hair to look your, their frail Gail and gait rules their capacity to lead
5/29/22, 12:26 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True. He can be blunt, but he needed to rally others
5/29/22, 12:26 AM - +234 703 714 8734: That is how they use their last energy to campaign, and when they win, they resume in a UK hospital bed
5/29/22, 12:27 AM - +234 810 006 7926: * young
5/29/22, 12:27 AM - +234 703 714 8734: After 8years of a Buhari, we shouldn't get another
5/29/22, 12:27 AM - +234 703 714 8734: The only hope of this country is Peter Obi
5/29/22, 12:28 AM - +234 810 006 7926: They know there is a rising youth population and the earlier they become get it and done with, the better, as age is not on their side.
5/29/22, 12:28 AM - +234 810 006 7926: May Atiku or Tinubu never be your President
5/29/22, 12:29 AM - +234 703 714 8734: 🙏
5/29/22, 12:30 AM - +234 806 537 0692: No need to make it my personal thing .... I don't want anyone of them and Nigeria does not need any of them .... But am being REALISTIC here!
5/29/22, 12:30 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Wike's stubbornness got us here, I am sure OBJ tried to warn him, but he will not listen
5/29/22, 12:30 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Don't make it personal on me!
5/29/22, 12:30 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Senior men trying to look like young men and rule over young men
5/29/22, 12:31 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Suzzy first say Amen.
5/29/22, 12:32 AM - +234 703 714 8734: If only he supported Zoning to southeast and the candidacy of Peter Obi, he would have become the father of a new Nigeria
5/29/22, 12:34 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Nothing personal sir, we should be able to have a point based argument without need for personal sentiments ...

You don't have more passion for change in Nigeria than I do
5/29/22, 12:36 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Wike tried but he fought alone. He did not see the need to work with Obi and Udom and Saraki. This was were Atiku was different, he was afraid of Wike and wanted a northern concensus but got only Hayatudeen to step down. He knew if he must defeat Wike, Tambuwal had to step down( don't forget Tambuwal got form and had already been promised Senatorial ticket)
5/29/22, 12:38 AM - +234 810 006 7926: How does saying Amen to a prayer make things personal?. May Atiku and BAT never become your president or mine!.

🙏🏼 Amen
5/29/22, 12:39 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Abiola ... Pray for yourself and pray for Nigeria ... We are all in this together ... I don't need a personal prayer from you on this ...

I don't need to say Amen just cos you said so, do I?
5/29/22, 12:41 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Let's not bandy words. Your the one taking things personal. If you noticed I avoided your line of questions. 
Let's just kill this
5/29/22, 12:42 AM - +234 806 537 0692: This is Nigeria politics ... No need being so sensitive and sending personal prayers ... Let's all make our points!
5/29/22, 12:42 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Just let this slide Susan.
5/29/22, 12:43 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Right after you!
5/29/22, 12:43 AM - +234 810 006 7926: May have to avoid you for now
5/29/22, 12:43 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Enjoy!
5/29/22, 12:44 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Sleep tight. May Atiku or BAT never become your president or mine!. For those who know

Amen 🙏🏼
5/29/22, 12:45 AM - +234 810 006 7926: A brother here said Amen.

Many people think APC will give the ticket to the North.

They won't 

It will go to the South to prove in action they support power shift to the South.

When the votes start coming in from the North in favour for Atiku that is when e go clear for everybody 

Osinbajo Jagaban Amaechi or Jonathan from APC will not be the president in 2023.

Take this to the bank

He just played politics. 

It's a game of interest and not of friends. 

Atiku had more to offer so Tambuwal made the politically rational move!
5/29/22, 8:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes he didn't betray anyone

If anyone actually betrayed it is Wike.

Your region SS has produced president. You are saying power should return to South. In fairness he could have zoned it to SE. But he wanted it for himself and by extension SS.

So he is the one who is the betrayer.

Same thing with the South West faction both in pdp and apc. Shouting for equity and fairness that Buhari has ruled power should come to South 

But they are scheming SE out of the equation.

Well APC Northern caucus will teach them a lesson.

5/29/22, 9:01 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Talking about this unity is simple 

Tambuwal is from Sokoto state which is northwest. Atiku from Adamawa which is northeast. 

But he stepped down for Atiku for collective interest of the North as a region.

That is why it came around to 371 votes.

What did the southern clowns do.

Wike chased Peter obi out with his potential delegates.

Wike got 237 votes
Akwa ibom governor refused to step down Anyim refused to step down and both had  to 52 votes.

If Peter had remained and there was unity. He will slash Atiku and Tambuwals delegates.

They will learn a bitter lesson.

His days at customs was not clean.

Majority of 12 million votes came from the south, in an election people voted for him to vote Buhari out. The south this time is not likely this time and the north would be divided.

Atiku who found it difficult to win the Pdp primaries will even find it more difficult convincing Nigerians why we should vote for a 75 year whose morals, religious tolerance and corruption status questionable.

5/30/22, 5:19 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Guys let's face reality 

Atiku is the next president come 2023

There are six geopolitical regions

Atiku will sweep North East and North West.

Peter obi will sweep South East.

If Atiku picks a South South Christian candidate he will share SS votes with Peter obi.

If Obi picks a northern Muslim he will share North Central votes with Atiku and a minute part of North East.

What is remaining is South West for APC candidate

Na pity remain for the APC candidate because the SW votes will be shares by both Atiku, Obi and the APC candidate with the APC candidate getting more of the votes.


Anyhow you check it Atiku comes out tops.


We'll just vote Obi as a matter of principle
5/30/22, 5:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 🤣🤣🤣You've given up.

May not play as you think though.

You need at least to win 21 states with at least 25 percent in each state to be president and I don't see him meeting the criteria.

Also don't forget between 2015 and now , we have people( mainly youths) who will be voting for the first time and for them integrity will be key. If Obi or Osibanjo is in the picture, it makes it very easy to defeat Atiku.

Remember Farmers whose farms have been ravaged by BH, IDP et Al are not likely to vote a candidate from the north, because they are angry their own have let them down and they fared better with a candidate from the south.

If Atiku found it difficult to win PDP primaries and he had to beg, he is not likely to find it easy with the general elections. His case may even be worse if APC fields a candidate from the north as this would divide the votes between Kwankwaso, Atiku and APC's candidate. And who majority of the south and middle belt will vote for will emerge president.

May the best candidate win!

Let Us Return Nigeria to Their Rightful Owners


I thank Nigerians; especially members of the Labour Party who have gathered here since yesterday to partake in the primaries to choose the person that will fly Labour flag in the forthcoming National election to choose the President of Nigeria.

History beckons. Nigerians remain hopeful for a national rebirth, which implies returning Nigeria to Nigerians –   farmers, teachers and students, lecturers, artisans, workers, pensioners and over a hundred million poor Nigerians who are not sure where their next meal will come from.

Therefore, what you are doing today is a patriotic duty towards seeking the desired political emancipation of our dear country, which stands wounded by many years of cumulative leadership failure. 
 
Painfully, our current dysfunctional system rewards unearned income and conspicuous consumption; allows university lecturers to remain on strike for months; keep our youths at home; and owe pensioners, who gave their patriotic sweat and their youthful energy to serve this country. 
 
The despicable contrast is that those responsible for the mess -those elected to take care of them - have abandoned the national currency and are living in opulence and like kings, spend dollars to buy delegates as well as houses all over the world.Meanwhile, they owe most workers, lecturers and retirees.

Yes, our country stands hijacked by forces of retrogression. We are almost zero in all indices of development. As a result, our future, especially those of the youth and generations unborn is in ruins. We have become a laughing stock among other nations, including African countries where we were once revered.
 
As a party that represents the workers and masses of this great nation, we are people organised and working for our economic rebirth.  As I am nominated today, I humbly proclaim that the journey towards the emancipation of the country has begun. 
 
I note with humility that the journey is going to be a collective one that will certainly require the cooperation of critical stakeholders in our country, especially the youth, whose future has been thoroughly degraded. 
 
I therefore thank all of you and call for your sustained support towards returning Nigeria to Nigerians from forces of bad leadership and retrogression. Such a noble tasks brooks no conscientious objectors.

I hardly use war metaphors for political analysis due to my belief that politics is not adversarial and not war. However permit me a little indulgence here, to relate what we are embarking on to the ancient battle of Thermopylae, where the Greek forces, conscious of fighting for the life of Greece held on against great odds in the defence of their country.
 
In the battle to re-take Nigerian, the odds are great and seemingly insurmountable, but with our commitment, patriotism and understanding that we are doing, what we are supposed to do for our country, lest she shall die, we shall move on discontent with what is and focused on enthroning what ought to be. In doing this, our battle cry shall remain: get your PVC and become part of this great libration!
Our governance mission will be twin-tracked. Secure Nigeria in every ramification: national security, human security, food security and tackling insecurity created by unemployment.
 
We will also seek to unite our nation by pulling our people out of poverty, and creating a new sense of nationalism and patriotism. Nigeria shall rise again: and her people will be proud to claim ownership of her patrimony. Doing so is in our collective national interest.   

As I earnestly thank Nigerians for their faith in me. In the days ahead I will publish our governance manifesto, which will spell out our top governance priorities.  I assure you that no region; state, local government or communities will be left behind. 
 
I also assure you all that the struggle continues and that victory is certainly in sight towards the guarantee of a meaningful future for our youths and making this country a respected and viable member of a 21st century world, that places high value on production over consumption.


God bless you all and God bless Nigeria.

Peter Obi

5/30/22, 6:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your right.

 But honestly,APC didn't have any political structure on ground before they surprisingly won( 3-4 ACN govs  in SW and one CPC governor in the north) in 2015. They won not really because they had a *solid* structure on ground but because people bought a propaganda that Jonathan was bad and wanted a change.

The dynamics has since changed since 2015. It is highly unlikely Nigerians will vote across party lines( rulling out the so called ' established structures'), but rather vote the personality.

APC won because of the 'perceived' personality of Buhari( though they know better now) not because of the supposed solid structures on ground. And that is why Nigerians may vote the person this time around not necessarily the party. Obi stands a chance and any other credible person APC might bring out.
5/30/22, 6:27 PM - +234 806 568 3004: APC had the combined structure of 5 Political Parties of which almost 4 had won at least one gubernatorial election. That's structure! 

Plus the financial war chest of the Tinubu's bullion vans! 


You can't compare that to the weak foundation that Peter Obi is building his Labour party house on!
5/30/22, 6:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes some structure but not Solid to win you the whole country
5/30/22, 6:30 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Exactly!
5/30/22, 6:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You so much bliv in this Tinubu Sha. Atiku gave each delegate 20,000 USD and was still calling them for over 5 hours begging and begging and had to beg Tambuwal to give him his delegates( moral been that Atiku's money was not enough to comfortably win the primaries)

Bullion van may not help BAT( He is infact afraid to spend now because of the EFCC and Okorocha's ordeal)
5/30/22, 6:32 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Exactly why Atiku will win the elections!
5/30/22, 6:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 🤣🤣🤣 I love your optimism Father Francis
5/30/22, 6:34 PM - +234 810 006 7926: And Nigerians will up their demand now and ask for 50 k instaed of the usual 10k and will still not vote Atiku
5/30/22, 6:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 👍🏼
5/30/22, 6:38 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We all want a better Nigeria. I am just reading the political signs. 

My prediction may be wrong but only time will tell.
5/30/22, 6:38 PM - +234 810 006 7926: True!
5/30/22, 7:00 PM - +234 817 034 1232: He was warned by the gods ahead of the primaries 

Friendly reminder.

Same way we are warning now for optimists in the coming election 😃

5/30/22, 10:30 PM - +234 817 950 7218: @2348065683004 I understand your pragmatism in the matter

However, the big question is, do you want Atiku to be president?

Yes he will likely be president but what really is the point in expending your energy discouraging people who are hoping for an alternative outcome?

Isn't it wiser to fight and push for what you think is right?

Is it the fear of failing that worries you?

Because if you don't fight you will lose, if you fight you likely will still lose but you will offer a few blows

I see no reason why you shouldn't actively campaign and rally for your preferred candidate. 

There are many who think like you, at least 100,000 PVC carrying Nigerians have this mentality. But if they all activity tried despite the fear of failure, they would probably collectively get upto 800,000 to 1,000,000 votes

If Peter Obi gets a decent 3rd with a few million votes it will be considered a good one

And I will encourage you to desist from discouraging those who are trying and instead join them to support because I don't see what there is to lose by trying

The worst that will happen is that Atiku will still win as predicted

And remember he needs 25% in at least 24 states. That's not going to be a walk in the park

He will get total majority but will he meet that criteria.

What happens if he doesn't? Constitutionally?
5/30/22, 10:34 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Well said Chinedu. 

I apologise if it appears that my comments were aimed at discouraging the efforts of those fighting to advance the objectives of Peter Obi and the 3rd force.
5/30/22, 10:36 PM - +234 806 537 0692: But ... Maybe his preferred candidate is Atiku 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ ... @2348065683004
5/30/22, 10:38 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I understand it very well and almost all of what you say is true

But, I think about it and wonder

Well, why not try?

What's the worst that could happen?

Except of course as a political you don't want to lose potential opportunities by documenting your support in certain directions
5/30/22, 10:41 PM - +234 806 568 3004: I agree that our little efforts will make a difference and give Peter Obi more votes even though he does not win. 

We can start the movement to change the status quo in Nigeria but that should be a continuum from the 2023 election.

I have always maintained that Peter Obi is the better candidate and I do not necessarily support Atiku. Rather, I am simply analyzing the issues as I see them. 

The worst that can happen which is obvious is that Peter Obi will not win but Nigerians are gradually passing a message about our democracy. 

Believe me, Regardless of the election outcome, that message has been passed. 

The old politicians already know that it is no longer business as usual and our democracy is improving. 

So we are gradually getting to our destination of a better democratic system but it is a marathon and not a marathon for 2023.
5/30/22, 10:42 PM - +234 706 098 3639: Why not try? ..what's the worst that could happen?👊🏼
5/30/22, 10:43 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We know the worst already!🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
5/30/22, 10:44 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Obi get better positioned for 2027 or 2031
5/30/22, 10:44 PM - +234 806 537 0692: You are so sure ... Hmmmmmm!
5/30/22, 10:44 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Time will tell. I will happy to be wrong!
5/30/22, 10:46 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I agree with you

I myself said it here that Peter Obi won't be president

But sometimes it can feel a little antagonistic

People are trying to start a movement and we know it's for the good

Yes he made some mistakes and SE generally haven't been politically great

But there's a wind blowing

Might as well add to the wave and see where it goes

It's almost like electively acting the fool and acting like it's possible

Because that's simply the best thing to do
5/30/22, 10:47 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly. Buhari got into power by getting a strong hold

That's what they build on

Peter Obi for here by entering the limelight as Atiku's VP candidate
5/30/22, 10:50 PM - +234 706 098 3639: At least this is better than voting between the devil and the deep blue sea!
5/30/22, 10:51 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
5/30/22, 10:53 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Exactly. Politics is about strategy. 

On that note, I agree with you that we should support the Obi movement knowing that the main vision is aimed at the next election and not the index one.
5/30/22, 10:55 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Thank you

It is our duty to take back our country from corrupt rogues.

5/31/22, 2:02 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Also note that in every nook and cranny of this country will you find a labour union affiliation. Now the NLC has adopted LP as the party for it's workers nationwide and recognized by the LP UK, it just takes organizing the Nigerian Union of Local govt workers(NULGE), Teachers( NUT), NULGE, TUC and woo NURTW. These affiliates are the structures on ground the labour party and PO can leverage on, by making All the workers, Okada riders, Drivers, Teachers, Market women buy into the ideology and run with it.

If APC in less than 2-3 yrs of her existence could win the general elections, I don't think it will be impossible for LP to win in this index general elections. I do not bliv it will have to be in 2031.

All that needs to be done is what Eric et al has begun, crowd funding, organisation and let the workers and students run with the ideology and what you think is herculean might not be.

Do not forget, it is the market women, drivers and okada that form the bulk of the 33 percent of All the registered voters that come out to vote.

It is doable and the time is now. Not in 2031. Why leave what we can collectively do now until the next 8 years(2031)?
5/31/22, 3:31 AM - +234 806 092 4290: For all of us pushing to get it right come 2023, how many of us have gone beyond social media, and probably beyond having PVC to ensuring our friends and families around us have one? This is where we should direct most of our efforts to as we continue to sensitise. Our collective dream can come true.

Beyond the political structures, I believe PMB won in 2015 because of the wind of change that blew then, that made him defeat an incumbent. I was part of it, and don't regret it despite the disappointments. Same way I was part of GEJ's train in 2011, which I don't regret it either. It made me believe we as a country can decide to change anyone that underperforms. Those that joined that train made it happen, not the bullion vans. Another opportunity has risen again for that change to happen and I am on the train already. 

Now, there is no incumbent, just new aspirants all across. This makes it even easier than 2015. If Obi doesn't win now, 2027 will be out of it, and by 2031, the energy may not be there. 
There's currently a wind of change blowing across the country and beyond, and there's only one train going with the tide. Let's join the moving train. There's going to be confusion in the 2 opposing camps, many will collect the money but will still end up with the moving train, except in remote areas where open balloting is practiced. 

On the other hand, even if PO doesn't win in 2023 (which I strongly believe he will win), whoever wins, will do so narrowly, and he will try to improve the situation of the country knowing well that the voice of the people counts a lot. He will largely not depend on his money again. That's why I hope Tinibu will not even make the slot, because Nigeria don't need any frail person to be on the seat while the cabals rule. This is why I believe that if PMB was younger and healthy, Nigeria wouldn't have been in this mess. 

If everyone that believes in this change ensures at least 10 persons around him or her has a PVC (new recruits not those already having one), then we will get there. I have done much more than 2015, and I hope to do more. The change is happening. We move
5/31/22, 5:38 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 😷😷😷😷😷😷
5/31/22, 7:26 AM - +234 806 921 7904: Great! 

I got my household registered and had some PVCs transferred.

I have helped a couple of youths in my neighborhood to do their online preregistration and pleaded with them to ensure the process is completed at INEC office.

I also did online PVC transfer for a couple staff in my department.

I sincerely wish INEC can extend registration deadline.

It's beyond social media, bro.

We must go to the grassroot!!

May God help save NIGERIA. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

5/31/22, 7:47 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 👍🏼 Well-done Dr Eric. I have had my PVC for a long time and I can't remember missing out voting in any General elections except when I was a presiding officer. There is a lesson I would like us to All know. It's beyond mobilisation and having your PVC. Of what use is having your PVC when you make the wrong choice?. It is when you vote the right candidate  that having your PVC would count. People voted Buhari and we All are paying dearly for it and to say you never regretted your decision, is not taking responsibility. It's a chain, it starts  like you both have rightly said with mobilising our house holds get their PVC and guiding them to vote for the right candidate and ensuring the process comes to fruition. 

Door to door mobilisation is key and that is why I love the way you have used social media in the take Nigeria back campaign. Having it at each local government level. The change must start from the local government level all the way up and not from up all the way down.

There is no polling booth on social media, but social media is a means stoking the flames of change.

This change is beyond Social media. It is 95 percent underground. 

Well-done Eric. You are indeed walking the talk!
5/31/22, 7:48 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Great and impressive work @2348069217904. I just skimmed thru a lot of the write up and so many solid points made. 
I totally understand @2348065683004 point. It’s the easiest approach to the threat of a looming defeat short of actually calling it a defeatist mentality. I also like that @2348179507218 analyzed it properly and shared a better direction or approach. @2348065683004 is a politician and is unlikely to take a clear position which is understandable.
5/31/22, 7:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Again I think that all of the thinking that limits Obis chances in this index election is premised on a Perceived “Realities”. But I also know that reality is a mix of known and unknown factors. Between now and Feb 2023, a lot of unknown could be earthed and dynamics change. In my experience, when solutions to problems are sought, often times it’s the craziest solution, the most unlikely that fits.
5/31/22, 7:59 AM - +234 806 921 7904: I totally agree with you, Abiola. 

It's a stepladder progress!

Registration deadline is at hand already.

We still have some time for grassroot mobilisation.

For now labour party has State and Ward coordinators.

The leadership cadre will be stepped further down.
5/31/22, 8:00 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 👍🏼 loved your last 2 paragraphs. It drove home the point
5/31/22, 8:09 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

5/31/22, 8:43 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I have helped and pushed no less than 30 persons to get PVC
5/31/22, 8:46 AM - +234 806 566 2895: We are working, trust me. During our march, TBN march, several groups paid INEC officials to register people. Even now it's still happening
5/31/22, 9:03 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Also there is a push for INEC to extend the deadline for registration to accommodate more people
5/31/22, 9:03 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I hope so
5/31/22, 9:13 AM - +234 806 537 0692: <Media omitted>
5/31/22, 9:16 AM - +234 806 537 0692: We strongly pray the extension works out ... So many people are still not registered ... Unfortunately those more affected are the Southerners here in the North
5/31/22, 9:18 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I don't regret and will never regret voting for PMB and voting out GEJ. The later was obviously incompetent to lead and I don't regret voting him out. There is no indication that we wouldn't have still plummeted into the calamity we found ourselves now. That PMB failed woefully does not exonerate GEJ's failure. That I don't regret voting who I thought was going to bring change doesn't mean I made the right choice. He has shown that he was a wrong choice, but we move until we get the right person. Even PO can only be validated as the right man, after he has gone in and prove us right. For night we are only hoping he is.
5/31/22, 9:19 AM - +234 806 537 0692: A typical grandmother from the north is ready to sit and wait for hours to get her registration done .... But for our own people, we have to beg them, carry them in vehicles to the INEC office, beg them to wait while lobbying with staff for faster means, buy them coke to keep them happy all in the bid to get them to do the right ... And some still walk away after all these ... It's sad and disheartening

5/31/22, 9:29 AM - +234 806 537 0692: We had a church youth campaign on voters registration last elections ... After doing so much to get people registered ... Do you know that some people have not collected their cards till today ... My INEC contact was gracious enough to collect them and give me ... They are still with me till today, owners refuse to collect ... All of them are young people ooo.

This time around we started the campaign since February and we are still dragging our people 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
5/31/22, 9:34 AM - +234 806 921 7904: Please don't be tired. Continue with the push.
5/31/22, 9:48 AM - +234 806 537 0692: We will not ... We have even added more strategies ... Provide data, getting someone to help them do online registration on their devices and help to have data capture done sharply ... It's stressful but WE MOVE!
5/31/22, 9:49 AM - +234 810 006 7926: He will if he wins. His antecedents transcends him. Couldn't say same for Buhari in 2015. Buhari was a mistake we shouldn't have had. We can move on and hope a credible candidate becomes president.

I'm happy we seem to be all on the same page now on qualities of who should preside over us going forward.
5/31/22, 9:50 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Well-done Susan!

5/31/22, 10:42 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 😊😊 I think you should do it discreetly so no one uses it against you. You can chat with them while consulting. But it may be safe to keep the bold notes away. Ethically you should be seen as non partisan while you consult.
5/31/22, 10:43 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Are you sure about this?

Please you have to be careful ...

5/31/22, 10:43 AM - +234 810 006 7926: You can use your warden to distribute it for you.

5/31/22, 10:45 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Even this may not be ethically correct ... Have a chat with them while establishing report during consultation ... This written paper can be very inditing.
5/31/22, 10:45 AM - +234 806 921 7904: Sure... thanks
5/31/22, 10:45 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Well-done Dr Eric. Your zeal and zest can be overwhelming infectious. Regards to yours.

5/31/22, 10:46 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I agree. It will be safe to say chat with them.

The questions the aspirants were asked included, “Do you have dual citizenship? Are you the subject of NJ investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission? Have you been arraigned by the Code of Conduct Bureau? And have you ever been convicted for a crime?”

Other questions asked include, “Have you ever been declared bankrupt? Will you be willing to step down for a consensus candidate? What is your manifesto? Will you abide by the party’s objectives and manifesto? What is your APC membership status?”

The aspirants were also asked to present original copies of their credentials including school certificates.

5/31/22, 1:17 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Best thing is for apc to get northerner
5/31/22, 1:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: That's the easiest ride for LP
5/31/22, 1:20 PM - +234 817 034 1232: They won't 

That would be risking splitting Atiku's vote.

APC will zone it to the South. 

They know what they are doing.
5/31/22, 1:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Who are the northerners running in APC
5/31/22, 1:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Exactly
5/31/22, 1:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And southwest
5/31/22, 1:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: To mess southern vote up
5/31/22, 1:21 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Gbam

That's the drill
5/31/22, 1:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Once this happens South should forget about presidency forever
5/31/22, 1:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It's an experiment
5/31/22, 1:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And once it succeeds the North will realise they can actually win alone
5/31/22, 1:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: There won't be need for any more alliance
5/31/22, 1:22 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes and I support it.

Maybe it will hasten a split.
5/31/22, 1:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Split can only happen in Nigeria the day South West wake up that it ought to happen
5/31/22, 1:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Until then toh alhamdulilah
5/31/22, 1:24 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You are right.

That is why the southwest will lose out in this election.


That will be the needed  ingredient to Foster unity
5/31/22, 1:59 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Not really you need to win 24 states with at least 25% I think in the remainder states to get a good spread to be president. The north has 19 states. The north cannot win the presidency on their own. They need other zones help
5/31/22, 2:00 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣 the people who made the law are the ones wanting the power sir

5/31/22, 2:02 PM - +234 803 097 7516: What do you do ?
5/31/22, 2:04 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think the north having more one candidate will split the votes, same for the south. Rather most people will likely vote the personality and someone who is ready to salvage the country, than vote across region, political party and I dear say religion.
5/31/22, 2:05 PM - +234 810 006 7926: And that is why Atiku needed someone from the East to be VP to meet that constitutional requirements. Unfortunately that thinking may be primordial and relegated to the past
5/31/22, 3:08 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Adamu is desperate to win, he will consider himself to have failed Buhari if he doesn't win presidential election for APC 2023, so he is not thinking about victory for the north, but victory for APC. Sadly for him, there is no game on his table that can produce for him a win, the closet game to win is Lawal, that that is still a lose. That is why APC is so confused right now, no sure win on their table
5/31/22, 5:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Voters registration extended till June 30th.

5/31/22, 7:40 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Sounthern Nigeria need to do more as regards a United front.
5/31/22, 7:58 PM - +234 805 611 8622: Well done Ayomoh!
5/31/22, 8:43 PM - +234 806 965 1788: *Breaking:-* *Nyesom Wike breaks silence over PDP Primary*............."I am not interested in becoming the Vice to Atiku. Tambuwal did not betray me like my neighboring brothers. PDP will win the election... and *I will be President of Nigeria by 2023*". "According to our Electoral Law, a contestant must vote, and be voted for. I am not ignorant of the law."  *~ Chief (Barr) Ezenwo Nyesom Wike.*
PDP flag might  squarely be with Wike. These are the reasons:
1. PDP NWC made a fundamental mistake by not amending the party constitution when it decided to throw away zoning and throw the contest open. The NWC decision cannot nullify the party constitution on rotation between the North and South. Whoever emerged from the north zone under this arrangement will be disqualified by the court. Since at the last election the party zoned the Presidency to the North and no southerner participated.
2. After Amaechi/Omehia replacement by the Supreme court the electoral process has been amended to require whoever will be replaced by the court to follow the primary electoral process to the end. Otherwise the court cannot replace the party flag bearer with another person. So it was imperative that Wike contest the process to the end. More importantly get the highest votes amongst the southern candidates. 
3. With the present position of Wike in the contest, he is in a position to successfully challenge in court the outcome of the party primaries. Wike cannot leave PDP now he MUST remain in PDP and seek court interpretation of the PDP zoning in the party constitution against the NWC decision to throw it open. I believe the party constitution is supreme to the NWC decision. 
Lastly, it does not matter if PDP submits Atiku's name to INEC, the courts will decide who the authentic PDP flag bearer is also.Amaechi/Omehia. 
It was a very good day for Wike. The scheming by the north was something we knew will happen so it was no surprise.  
The court will decide the final outcome of the primaries.

5/31/22, 9:05 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Well,the amechi/omehia precedence may sound very exciting for wike but on a federal level,things wouldn't play out that simply...sprinkle some ethnic sentiments and you have a potentially difficult task implementing wike's supposed plans
5/31/22, 9:06 PM - +234 803 281 3842: The courts have never decided a presidential election in Nigeria....e get why
5/31/22, 9:06 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Good luck to wike sha...I am not a believer on this one.
5/31/22, 9:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Simple 

Most times in life the simplest solution is usually the answer.

In this case Justice Tanko as the supreme Court Head he will interpret it to Atiku's favour.
5/31/22, 9:07 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Wike is a smart politician and very much familiar with the court system in Nigeria and he knows his ways.
5/31/22, 9:08 PM - +234 806 965 1788: It's all about the PDP's constitution. there is little Justice Tanko can do
5/31/22, 9:09 PM - +234 806 965 1788: It is still a party affair which is a pre election matter.
5/31/22, 9:09 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Let's watch and see how events unfold.
5/31/22, 9:09 PM - +234 803 281 3842: His acumen isn't in doubt but there is no omnipotence to his plans. The dynamics of state and federal politics has some unique differences that might hamper his "well crafted " plans
5/31/22, 9:10 PM - +234 806 965 1788: 👍🏼
5/31/22, 9:13 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Chief, Right now Wike is authentic PDP flag bearer.

In PDP constitution, zoning is well spelt out.

Chairmanship position and flag bearer are usually  in opposite side according to constitution.

In 2019, Secondus (a southerner) was chairman and Atiku was flag bearer after zoning it to North.

In 2023, Iyorcha Ayo( a Northener) who happen to be a long time Atiku ally during the time of GDM, became PDP Chairman and jettisoned zoning so that Atiku will benefit again.

They did not know that a legal trap have been set for them.

To amend PDP constitution is not a day job and any amendment you made now is null and void with no effect.
5/31/22, 9:15 PM - +234 803 281 3842: True...what will be the position of the party if atiku wins ( na hypothetical case o) and wike approaches the court as planned? Will the pdp chairman side with wike? After just celebrating atiku's victory? Will the chairman risk falling out with the president elect in the event that the court interpretation favours the elected atiku? So many issues that cannot be controlled for this wike's scheme to work
5/31/22, 9:15 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

Consolation

This permutation will not work.

Tanko will interpret it in favour of Atiku.
5/31/22, 9:16 PM - +234 703 199 4953: My brother, you can say that again. That's how they went n did Makaba dance (hope I got that right) in PDP primaries. We're watching. Let them all finish all their primaries first...

6/1/22, 10:06 AM - +234 817 034 1232: What he said is true.

Numbers don't lie.

Our people say when two brothers fight to the death; a stranger inherits their property. It's a proverb.

This is what happened at the convention.

Most southeastern politicians are foolish, likely more foolish than other regions.

Going back to the proverb.
They gave their votes to Tambuwal, some to Atiku.
The Tambuwal carried their votes and gave to Atiku his brother.

Apparently Tambuwal understands this proverb more than the southeastern politicians who usually chant  this proverb.

But most of them are shameless and will not learn.

While we blame Wike for costing the South the votes. The igbo politicians are also to blame.

We don't take sides. When my people misbehave we say it as it is. So we can have the moral courage to criticise or praise others too.

On this note the southeasterners also goofed  too.
6/1/22, 10:06 AM - +234 817 034 1232: We have 😃

6/1/22, 2:14 PM - +234 703 714 8734: President Muhammadu Buhari is backing the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo as his preferred aspirant ahead of the National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) billed to hold this weekend in Abuja.

A senior presidential aide who disclosed this to our correspondent yesterday said Buhari strongly believed that having worked closely with him since May 2015, Osinbajo is the best aspirant to continue with the policies of the administration.

The president is also said to be impressed with the way the Vice-President has piloted the affairs of the country during the period he held fort as Acting President.

He said this backing by Buhari is responsible for the confidence Osinbajo has exuded so far in the race for the presidential ticket of the party.

Speaking further, he said following the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), some power brokers in the APC tried to project Senate President, Ahmad Lawan as their best so as to rival Atiku in the North but their proposal was rejected.

"As at today, Tuesday, the President is firmly behind the Vice-President as his preferred aspirant. He has refused to shift ground even after some members of his kitchen cabinet started rooting for Ahmad Lawan after the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as PDP presidential candidate".

" Some northern powerful forces and religious leaders are pushing for a Northern candidate while others are behind the moves to draft former President Goodluck Jonathan into the race so that he can serve just one term and return power back to the North in 2027 but Buhari is not buying into all that".

"Those pushing for Lawan had argued that since Atiku is from the North East of Adamawa, the APC should also present its candidate from another North- East state but the proposal was quickly shot down by some concerned stakeholders who also have the ears of the President".

"Those against Lawan argued that if fielded as APC presidential candidate, the election will be a walkover for PDP and Atiku as he will even beat the Senate President hands down in in his home state of Yobe. The only place Lawan is popular is in Yobe North Senatorial District" our source said.

6/1/22, 2:43 PM - +234 703 714 8734: If yemi emerges, he will scatter the voting dynamics, no more landslide victories, northerners loyal to Buhari will give him some votes, SW will give him some votes, Atiku will also take some north and SW votes, Peter Obi will also take his. It will become a difficult election to predict election, but deciding votes will come from the north central and youths. Peter Obi may still spring a surprise by locking down SE and a majority of NC and youth votes, since his supporters are locked on having a new Nigeria, a change in the game

6/1/22, 2:50 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Take kano for example, ganduje has a senatorial elections, as his boys in APC ticket positions, those masses may not know how to understand to vote his APC and Atiku in PDP. Anything they campaign for is top to bottom like Buhari said, to make it easy for their less educated masses to run with
6/1/22, 2:52 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It's complex in the North but always remember that it is always about what protect Muslims and Islam

So much has gone wrong in all sectors of human development.

All our health indices are among the worst globally.

We witness lots of avoidable deaths daily, and can't do much about them.

We know so much, but are unable to truly help our patients because of the terrible work environments.

We have non functional hospitals, while many more are still being built, with the sole aim of siphoning public funds.

Our colleagues and other members of the public are kidnapped and robbed regularly.

Very many of us who had no plans of leaving the country at any point have been forced to leave.

The status quo is not sustainable. 

An urgent RESCUE is a must. 

A New Nigeria is a must.

In Governor Peter Obi, we have a man with a rich antecedent of of good governance, especially as Governor of Anambra State.

He is offering himself to take us out the woods, to champion the rebuilding process of a New Nigeria, and Nigerians have become hopeful of a promising future once again.

He is already candidate of the Labour Party, and with our support he can become President of Nigeria in 2023.

He needs all of us to make it happen, not for himself and his family, but for over 200 million Nigerians and generations yet unborn.

Here is a CLARION CALL to us all, all Nigerian Medical Doctors across the globe, to join the RESCUE MISSION, through the RESCUE Doctors division of Peter Obi to the RESCUE Group.

Being in one place, as men and women of the same profession, will enable us rub minds more effectively, and make the most contribution to this most worthy cause.

Let's get together and begin to chart the course for the  emergence of a New Nigeria, the Nigeria of our dreams.

God continue to bless us all so richly, now and always.


Conveners,

6/3/22, 8:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He will not be president of this country 

Not going to happen 🤣
6/3/22, 8:50 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Ethnocentric, arrogant, power hungry and to top it all, absolutely clueless...

Everything we don't want right now
6/3/22, 8:50 AM - +234 806 566 2895: As in eh
6/3/22, 8:51 AM - +234 817 034 1232: This one go sell Nigeria completely
6/3/22, 8:51 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/3/22, 8:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I tell yoi
6/3/22, 8:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Tinubu na proper Aba boy😂
6/3/22, 8:53 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Somehow I wish he can get the ticket so that he will be thoroughly humiliated by the electorates...if Osinbajo doesn't get the ticket
6/3/22, 8:55 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Did you watch the video where he was being screened by the APC screening committee? He appeared to be talking off point and forgetting what he was saying. My problem with him being president is that he is presently not physically and mentally sound.
6/3/22, 8:56 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's the least of it

The man is obviously battling with senility. That's not debatable

Yet, go and rest, no
6/3/22, 9:02 AM - +234 806 092 4290: It has become a do or die affair. On this rate, I wonder what will become of him if he fails to clinch the presidency. His likely to go into severe depression
6/3/22, 9:05 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I promise you he will scatter this country.

You never see tantrum

He will set out to destroy APC and whatever is left of Buhari's government
6/3/22, 9:07 AM - +234 806 092 4290: He may sponsor unrest, crime and assassinations
6/3/22, 9:08 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You see the fundamental problem with Buhari was incompetence

No matter how hard he tried, fixing Nigeria was beyond him.

He was simply lacking in knowledge not desire

But Buhari correctly realized that Tinubu is GREEDY and is a very dangerous person to give so much power. Which is why he's trying to thwart him
6/3/22, 9:09 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Imagine one man deciding for almost two and half decades who rules Lagos?

Then you give him Nigeria. His son would be governor of Anambra
6/3/22, 9:10 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't think he'd go that far, but he'd undermine the government with politically.

House of Assembly/Senate things
6/3/22, 9:14 AM - +234 806 092 4290: If Osibanjo can clinch the APC ticket, it will clip Tinibu's wings and limit the havoc he can cause, because the SW will rather support one of their sons than ruin everything because of one dictator. If both of them miss out, he will have many sympathisers from the SW that will further distabilize the already sinking ship called Nigeria
6/3/22, 9:16 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You think so. Most of these politicians are ready to kill and cause havoc for anything, talk less of someone as influential and powerful as Tinibu
6/3/22, 9:20 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Okay
6/3/22, 9:20 AM - Paul Ashir: Cautery aided abi na minimal antimetabolite direct use.

6/4/22, 7:17 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Taken out of context. I watched it and he only praised the interests of the youths. He emphasised how the criteria they used included "experience" and "contribution to nation and party building, including making the party a ruling party". I think that sneaks BAT in. He further said only one aspirant disagreed with consensus, except he is the chosen one. That is also likely to be Tinibu.
I believe they can't disqualify him but will ensure he looses the ticket

6/4/22, 10:30 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Ministerial and Ambassadorial positions guaranteed with 100M.

Good deal🤔🤔🤔
6/4/22, 10:30 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Basically 100M is simply the price for saying you're interested in APC

Tinubu Osinbajo Fayemi strong contenders

Amaechi and Lawan second set of contenders.

Yahaya Bello and the rest weak contenders

But it will be glorious if he does

6/4/22, 3:30 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Well if he gets it...it's even much better 

Lol
6/4/22, 3:30 PM - +234 806 092 4290: It's not that it is not possible but he is unlikely the annoited candidate

CHOOSE WISELY.copied
6/4/22, 5:42 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I don't know how true Atiku's quote is but the remaining ones are spot on. For Osibanjo, he has no choice than to praise the government he is part of. After all, it is not that they didn't do anything good at all, only that the bad ones are too much that they overshadowed anything good they did

We are delighted by the decision of our esteemed colleague, His Excellency, Governor Abubakar Badaru to  contribute to this patriotic quest by withdrawing his presidential aspiration.  
The APC has a duty to ensure that the 2023 elections offer a nation-building moment, reaffirming that a democratic pathway to power exists for all who value cooperation and build national platforms. This moment calls for the most sober and inclusive approach to selecting our party’s candidate, and we call on all APC leaders to fulfil their responsibility in this regard.

The gods always speak directly to their genuine prophet.

South it goes.


They won't risk splitting Atiku's votes which is the grand plan.

It will be zoned to the southwest. 

They won't risk an alliance of Southwest Southeast and southsouth because the bulk of North Central will like vote South this time.


This move by the 11 governors is not out of altruism or magnanimity

At least the southwest is still fighting for the position, they are even better.

What about the foolish ones from the east? While the northern governors are pushing for the South to get it....Umahi a presidential aspirant and Orji Uzor kalu are canvassing support for Lawan. The possible delegates for Ogbonnaya Onu are canvassing support for Lawan to

Apparently among the South the Eastern politicians are the most foolish 🤣

You can count reasonable politicians from SE on one finger

6/5/22, 5:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Toh
6/5/22, 5:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Very true
6/5/22, 6:21 AM - +234 803 458 5862: I must disagree with my beloved "Prophet" this time. They will NEVER want to be in the opposition, contrary to what you think. They know that no northern candidate can match Atiku as it stands so their best shot at remaining in power is an Osinbajo and maybe a Zulum or the senate President (who I was shocked to hear has a PhD in education🤔)
Trust me, APC members DO NOT WANT TO BE IN THE OPPOSITION. Malami and co will not want to be at the other side of Atiku's/PDP's barrel.
Interestingly, the screening committee ranked Osinbajo highest in their report 🤣🤣
6/5/22, 6:40 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay

But knowing Atiku's personality he will not go after most of them in opposition.

He is not really the vendetta kind of person, so they are banking on that.
6/5/22, 6:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Osinbajo as prophesied all along.

But the two strong contenders behind the scenes are Tinubu and Amaechi actually.

Osinbajo will be used to settle the consensus...at worst Fayemi if push comes to shove.


😃
6/5/22, 6:50 AM - +234 803 458 5862: We've not been given good options by the system or delegates but Atiku will have a landslide cruise if the APC does not give PYO. At that point, the Golden boy of Labour may just force the country to the first re-run because none will be able to muster 50% of the total votes with 25% in 2/3 of the states.
My thoughts...
6/5/22, 6:51 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You are right👌🏼
6/5/22, 7:12 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Do we know the type he is? Atiku has never held veto power, so we don't know whether he is the vendetta seeking type. His constant pursuit of that seat makes me assume that he might just have a bone to pick with someone...maybe his former boss ,obasanjo, or someone else.. Even if am wrong, power changes people. Who knows what absolute power will change him into?
6/5/22, 7:53 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Atiku is not that type

Even if he wants vendetta it's  against obasanjo but he won't considering he is old already to wear him out.

Secondly after winning the ticket he has been receiving and building bridges with those who voted and contested against him.

He is not Buhari...as long as he can lay his hand on money he is fine.


He tries to appease both sides that's his personality.

If you see any vendetta against anyone in his government you can rest assured it's one of his allies.

You can read ones personality with the existence of social media😃
6/5/22, 8:29 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Osinbanjo remains APCs surest candidate most likely to give them a win, lockdown on SW votes, and a few votes in every place is likely to push him far. Atiku's 2023 ticket is an unfair and unjust ticket, cos it is the turn of the south, so Atiku 2023 will not get the blessings of the upright and no one can win with only northern votes
6/5/22, 8:34 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Narrow Analysis
6/5/22, 8:37 AM - +234 703 714 8734: I promise you, Atiku will get less votes in 2023 than he had in 2019
6/5/22, 8:37 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Ok pastor
6/5/22, 8:54 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Good morning. I think you have it wrong. The south East is playing a particular card this time. The expectation was that no candidate from the SS or SW would pick a form and they would collectively support the SE. but since the SW and SS have decided they are too greedy, the SE won’t play the solidarity card anymore. Let the power remain in the north instead. This is the Card Orji Kalu detailed quite recently.
6/5/22, 8:55 AM - +234 803 281 3842: So, where is Peter Obi in this your narration? Have you silently concurred that he won't win?
6/5/22, 8:56 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I doubt if Obi aligns with this idea
6/5/22, 8:58 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Obi is not in APC
6/5/22, 8:59 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Obi is also not campaigning on grounds of regional rotation of power. This pivot is that of the APC SE politicians
6/5/22, 8:59 AM - +234 803 097 7516: You didn't indicate APC south east here
6/5/22, 9:00 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I didn’t see the need to because the discourse was already centres around APC contenders
6/5/22, 9:00 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Centred* pardon me
6/5/22, 9:00 AM - +234 703 013 1067: Even our clueless is part of the plan.
6/5/22, 9:00 AM - +234 803 097 7516: No worries
6/5/22, 9:01 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think it’s an ingenious card. The SS and SW must learn how to play regional politics
6/5/22, 9:02 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And understand solidarity. If power stays in the north another 8 years maybe just maybe they would have learnt their lessons and stop throwing out ridiculous numbers of candidates like people going for a trials for the Olympic
6/5/22, 9:10 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Peter Obi lockdown SE, NC and a few here and there pushing him ahead, I have said before that the coming of Osinbanjo will scatter voting dynamics and make landslide victories impossible, winning margins will be slim and unpredictable, I have said these before. For Atiku, remember that his majority of 2019 votes came from the south, so he will be looking for new northern votes same as the other candidates, and you can be sure he will loss a big chunk of his former SE, SW and NC votes
6/5/22, 9:15 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I think it's a southern thing bro
6/5/22, 9:15 AM - +234 803 097 7516: If this was SS in it, SE would do same
6/5/22, 9:35 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: <Media omitted>
6/5/22, 9:36 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You are going to want to look at these numbers and review your analysis
6/5/22, 9:39 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Total North votes - 16m roughly. 
Total South Votes - 9m roughly. 

Anyone who will be President needs an overwhelming support and a very FIRM 🤝 across the Niger!

It would be suicidal to think Atiku will get all the votes from the north. Like I always said , Atiku found it difficult to win the PDP primaries, begging his way when his money failed him. He is unlikely to get it easy in the general elections and we are tired of his serial attempts to preside over us. He needs to retire from this elections after an overwhelming defeat

Terrorism is now at our doorstep🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️

The people in that church could have had guns at home but that didn't help them wen the gunmen came

6/5/22, 3:45 PM - +234 803 097 7516: No. HAUSAS are the victims of those attacks in Zamfara, Sokoto and most places.

6/5/22, 4:12 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly I don't know why people are saying it's politically motivated.

If people cannot realise that Buhari and his jihadists are at work then they will be consumed 

Politically motivated how? Who will benefit from it politically 


When we call for separation of the country, this is one of the major reasons.

Yet we are not supposed to discuss this issue because it is sensitive.

The dangers of not discussing outweighs the danger of discussing it

Because anyone here can be a victim.

All you need is to accuse one of blasphemy if you don't like the person's face and you will be killed

6/6/22, 6:06 AM - +234 703 714 8734: We’ll raise 30m voters for Obi before election — Okupe, Peter Obi Campaign DG
June 5, 2022


Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, the Director-General of the Peter Obi Presidential Campaign Organization, Dr. Doyin Okupe, says his team would raise about 30 million voters for the Labour Party, LP, and its candidate, Mr. Peter Obi, to emerge victorious at the polls.


Okupe, who jettisoned his presidential ambition for Obi, spoke against the assertions by some quarters that the former Anambra governor does not have the structure to win a presidential election.

In an interview with Sunday Vanguard, the former Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to President Olusegun Obasanjo expressed optimism that the LP’s candidate would become the next President of Nigeria because he was the best of the very best.

 
“We have a saleable candidate. We have a candidate that is adjudged to be the best in Nigeria currently. We have a currency that is comparable to none. Peter Obi, in terms of currency, is the sure bet that’s available politically in Nigeria today. It is impossible for any political party to produce any candidate that can match him in terms of performance and integrity. He has over proven that he’s a man that has integrity. In terms of antecedents, what he did in Anambra State is classic and exemplary. In terms of execution, knowledge and exposure especially in the economy, no aspirant or candidate comes close to him”, the DG stated.

According to him, Obi’s presidency would focus on changing the country from consumption to production, reducing poverty, changing the attitude of governance from the elites collecting together to share to encouraging people to create wealth, and leading and managing governance resources responsibly, transparently and honestly.


 
“Obi is going to be strong on education because that is the basis of growth and progress. He’s going to be very strong in agriculture too. He has gone all over the country talking about agriculture, talking about the potential we have in a country that is over one million square kilometres and yet, we are not exporting as much as countries that are not up to one-third of our size like Vietnam,”he stated.

Okupe, who was also a Senior Special Assistant on Public Affairs to President Goodluck Jonathan, described Obi’s defection to the LP from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as an inevitable decision taken to save Nigeria from the hand of corrupt politicians.


 
He said: “The truth of the matter is that when people talk about political structure, you are actually referring to human beings, and the LP as it is presently constituted has the greatest number of members even more than very well known political parties if combined or put together.

“In Labour Party, you have the NLC, the TUC, the market women, the farmers, the artisans, the students, the professionals and the entire working class, and so on. That’s the ramification, the extent the party drives its strength.


 
“So what Peter Obi’s presence is doing is to attract the structure and its attraction to the youth is going to reawaken the strength of the LP, reinvigorate it and task its members to come in and take their position in the scheme of things”.

On the Obi’s massive social media following, the DG added: “Yes, he has a massive following on social media but his following and the political revolution that he’s leading presently is far beyond social media. He’s broken the bounds of what the new media is all about. Obi today is the very essence of Nigerian politics. If you go to the market, church, mosque, or enter a taxi or a bus, everybody, farmers, religious leaders, is talking about him.

“The dynamism of the youthful population and their strength and capacity in terms of electoral advantage is going to shock the country. I’m telling you that between now and January next year, the Peter Obi movement will put together between 25 – 30 million people and I don’t see any existing political party that can top that.

“Nigerians both young and old, are tired of our political platforms that have been exchanging powers between the PDP and the APC and you know, the line between the two has actually disappeared. The truth of the matter is that in terms of political relevance, the APC and the PDP have expired. And you know that nature abhors a vacuum, so the third force of young people will now have to take over to rescue the country.”

When asked if Obi would be willing to collapse his structure with other political parties like Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwaso ‘s New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Okupe answered: “Merging, cooperation, coalition, all those tendencies are possible but the goal is constant. We want Obi to run the affairs of this country because he’s the best person right now to do it. He’s the one that has enough knowledge and experience and proven ability to physically manage our economy and our finances. 

So, we will do anything lawful and legal, we will make concessions to bring in people, we are going to bring the biggest coalition ever before the election, you will see it.”

6/6/22, 4:57 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Tricky though. They should have given a weak Southern so that the north have one focus

6/6/22, 5:07 PM - +234 806 092 4290: @2348030977516, I will beg to differ. They chose Adamu because they feel they can retain power through a northern candidate. Most of them don't want Atiku there.
I want to see this as a great opportunity for Peter Obi. Only the South can make Peter Obi loose
6/6/22, 5:09 PM - +234 806 092 4290: If they really wanted Atiku, they will not support à Northern candidate

6/6/22, 5:11 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Unlikely APC will field a candidate who will loose elections and make them loose. Buhari's wants APC to retain power and wants a candidate who will win. Lawan is Adamu's candidate. The superdelegate Buhari has a huge part, and Lawan is not definitely not in Buhari's picture.

It's just 24 hours to the convention and you will hear things, later in the evening Adamu may come to deny it.

Until this time 2mrw, we cannot be certain it is Lawan. 

Don't forget he doesn't have the clout in his state Yobe and don't have the control of his states delegates like his governor and his has been in the Senate for 20 years and couldn't become governor. He is hiding under a concensus as  pushed by the Cartel, as he is unlikely to win the primaries
6/6/22, 5:11 PM - +234 803 097 7516: APC can't retain the seat you know that
6/6/22, 5:12 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Even if they can't, they don't want to loose
6/6/22, 5:13 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Buhari will rather field a candidate he believes will win and retain power than let PDP come back
6/6/22, 5:13 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Let's see
6/6/22, 5:16 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's just gimmicks. You will begin to hear people stepping down( true and untrue).

Kalu said 10 Aspirants will step down for Lawan. Where are they?

Don't fall for the gimmicks. Nothing is impossible, but it is highly unlikely.
6/6/22, 5:16 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Apc ticket goes to southwest

6/6/22, 5:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: @2348030977516 . Highly unlikely Lawan. But this is politics, anything can happen
6/6/22, 5:23 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 👆
6/6/22, 5:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Right,and that is why I said the super delegate and governor's have a huge role to play
6/6/22, 5:25 PM - +234 803 097 7516: NWC controls the delegates though
6/6/22, 5:25 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Super delegate been Buhari
6/6/22, 5:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think it's the governor's mainly. Though Adamu has tried to alter the list and is at Loggerheads with the governor's. 

The Governor's and President is likely to speak with one voice, Adamu and his cohorts are likely to disagree subtly.

Anyway one cannot stick out his neck in Nigerian Politics.
6/6/22, 5:29 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I feel so too
Whichever way, I believe APC is not interested in relinquishing power to PDP.
6/6/22, 5:29 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The confusion may work in favour of the opposite and Peter Obi may win o🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

I hope AAA will not be bought over by Tinibu's bullion van tomorrow leaving white lion alone in the fight

COMMENT ON THE STATEMENT MADE BY A LEADING APC FLAGBEARER CANDIDATE

It is perhaps not surprising that on the eve of the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer primary there are those running as candidates who wish to associate themselves with the President’s rise to elected office seven years ago.

There are many people who played parts large and small in his historic election in 2015, making history as the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president with power changing hands peacefully at the ballot box.

There are those who advised the President to run again; those who decided to build a political party – the APC – that could finally be the political vehicle capable of delivering victory where all other opposition parties and alliances before it had failed.

Those decisions may have been agreed upon by a few. But they were delivered by thousands and voted for by tens of millions. No one can or should claim to have made the possible.

Yet as important as that moment was, it is not what should decide the next general election.

What matters is the future: the policy platforms, the ideas, the drive, and the determination to take over the President’s stewardship of our country and build upon his legacy to make our country better than it has ever been.

The person most demonstrable in those qualities is the one to lead our party and our country forward.

6/7/22, 7:06 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Forget these guys. They're speaking with both sides of their mouth to drift away the attention of Nigerians from their plan, until it happens. They will do the bidding of Mr Psdnt, but they would want Nigerians to blame the delegates for taking such a decision, hence this tactic. We know them.

To me the SE reacted naturally correct by canvassing for a northern candidate. If the SW and SS cannot reciprocate the support that SE gave them during Obasanjo and GEJ time, then those regions won't be able to attract their support anymore. That is what the North are cashing on to take power again. If all the south don't want a South east psdnt, they should also not clamour for their (SE) support. It's that simple.
Nonetheless, there is a chance to mend fences if all the major parties zone their psdncy to the North. The SS and SW can rally around PO to make him win, so that they can owe eachother support subsequently. It's good for Peter Obi if APC and PDP field a northern candidate.
6/7/22, 7:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But still apoptotic
6/7/22, 7:10 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Nice submission 👌🏼
6/7/22, 7:21 AM - +234 806 092 4290: While your submission is apt, can you also give an evidence that the SE political giants are supporting their zone? Those backing the North are doing so because of their personal interests not because they want to fight the SS or SW. If they were united and then they noticed betrayal and decided to shift their allegiance then we can argue that. SE are their own enemies

6/7/22, 9:37 AM - +234 706 815 1299: I still think their support for the North is mainly for my aforementioned reasons. Somethings are matters of principles. Yes I agree that most Igbos are independent minded, but I have seen many times where interest binds them together for a common good. Igbos are not as divided as many of us think. If they were that divided, their votes would have splitted across all the regions. Can you tell me any other region that gave block votes in the last presidential elections better than SE, other than the NW or possibly NE? How did they achieve that if they're as divided as we all tend to suggest some times. Once their interest is captured by the power brokers, they will all eventually align to support it.

6/7/22, 9:50 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Adamu will not just give up because of a failed declaration of concensus, he will push his agenda through the delegates today, remember that his agenda has Buhari's blessing. The contest today is between Tinibu and Lawal, the rest are spectators
6/7/22, 9:52 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Unity in supporting the North; is that not enough?
6/7/22, 9:55 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Yes, once apoptotic initiation caspases are activated, the cascade will automatically continue to its logical conclusion with subsequent activation of the execution caspases and that is what happened.
6/7/22, 9:56 AM - +234 806 092 4290: That doesn't buttress your initial point that they are uniting for the North because the SW and SS failed to unite to support their bid. When did they show sign of uniting for a common goal of presenting a credible candidate from the SE, that they noticed betrayal before jumping ship? When we even say they are uniting for the North, who are the "they"? The few ones looking for relevance and how to maintain their finance?
6/7/22, 9:58 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Is there any other region that presented one candidate? They're like all other regions oga.

6/7/22, 10:06 AM - +234 806 092 4290: That is my point. There is no difference across regions, so no need saying they are backing the North because other parts of the South refused backing them when they never showed any sign of forming a formidable force to take over power. The only likely candidate from the East that could alter the status quo, they abandoned him. Everyone is fighting for their own selves
6/7/22, 10:14 AM - +234 810 006 7926: If he See's this through all the delegates( which is unlikely), he would have bought his mandate with close to 40 billion Naira. If this happens, then you and I will have no right to complain for the next 8 years when things go wrong, if( just if there is a slight margin), he becomes president. After all he or an Atiku owe nobody any explanation since they bought their way. You don't get an explanation from a self entitled family, who think they have done us more favours than we deserve.

Very likely Nigerians will milk Tinubu and vote someone else. After all it's public funds he looted that he is recklessly sharing for selfish gains .

6/7/22, 10:41 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Yeah

They will give BAT the party.

And indirectly align their support for Atiku

Afterward, decamp if Atiku wins to PDP.

No party system in Naija, only interest system.

Let's see how obi would peterize the whole game and make Naija solid again
6/7/22, 10:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The gods say Tinubu will be the flag bearer of APC

Power may never or become a miracle to come back to south.

It would all become change of party system to favour north in power.

If agitated southerners show up, they will bribe them out or open their file of corruptions with severe consequences for them to do the needful.

Las las, the north appear to be more selfless and why they appear smart in politics.

6/8/22, 10:28 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It is Bode. It's not necessarily just contrarian but real negativity

You haven't suggested what we'd do that's my point

But you've stated that we'd be concerned about bombing, Fulani and low voter registration without a defeatist air

People are queueing, spending time, spending their money, entering villages to sensitize people but you're focused on the challenges

That's why I asked, what would you like us to do

Vacate the country?
6/8/22, 10:29 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Ok you've correctly mapped the risk, now control the hazard or mitigate the risk

6/8/22, 10:29 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But you see it is what it is
6/8/22, 10:29 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And a sad reality is that when it comes to Nigerian politics and election
6/8/22, 10:29 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It goes beyond passion
6/8/22, 10:30 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And beyond positivity or negativity of any individual
6/8/22, 10:30 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It is a complex systemic process
6/8/22, 10:30 AM - +234 806 876 9591: 🤷🏻‍♂️
6/8/22, 10:30 AM - +234 803 097 7516: That have multiple factors
6/8/22, 10:30 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Me and you here are very important micro minute factor
6/8/22, 10:31 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's easy to identify flaws, but the change we seek isn't spurred by people with two heads

I love public health for one singular reason, it solution oriented. It teaches one to think.

The truth is that you're without hope for the country and you can't help that it permeates

Here's an exercise, suggest a solution or you don't think there is any?
6/8/22, 10:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Politics is not public health sir
6/8/22, 10:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Public health has identified players
6/8/22, 10:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Donor, implementer and beneficiaries
6/8/22, 10:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: That's not politics
6/8/22, 10:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol
6/8/22, 10:33 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I think you seeing politics as program implementation
6/8/22, 10:33 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I'm politics the players are classified into identifiable and non identifiable
6/8/22, 10:33 AM - +234 803 097 7516: External and internal
6/8/22, 10:34 AM - +234 803 097 7516: We only know the identifiable players at our level sir
6/8/22, 10:34 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Sadly the identifiable players as inconsequential🤣🤣 when the real game comes
6/8/22, 10:38 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's exactly the same, it's just you don't see😂

I'm shocked you're inferring public health is free of politics. I can site several examples from reduced funding for HIV due to LGBTQ discrimination, the type of programs funded. Funding health programs to gain intelligence😅

Brother there's politics in health and it greatly determines health outcomes

It's a simple case of problems and solutions... Be it politics or public health


There's something I've noticed though but I won't speak of yet...

This defeatist mentality is seemingly associated with two factors
6/8/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol global health rather is not free of politics. Politics run the world sir. I haven't said public health which Is sub sect of global health is free
6/8/22, 10:39 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Realist vs Defeatist mentality🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
6/8/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But programmatic politic are not same sir
6/8/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: With a country politic. No two political setting are ever same
6/8/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Guess why?
6/8/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The players!!
6/8/22, 10:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Who determines a political stage is the unidentified players
6/8/22, 10:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Not the candidate, not the voters who are just mere identifiable players
6/8/22, 10:41 AM - +234 803 097 7516: You telling me there is politics in public health is like a professor of politics science telling trump there is politics in COVID . Alas Trump knew and he played in it. 🤣🤣
6/8/22, 10:42 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Even local public health, you don't have to go far

Politics determines number of teaching hospitals, location of hospitals etc😒
Why the need for advocacy and policy, if not the recognition of politics?

My point is what is lacking here is critical thinking, which requires that we come up with solutions. It's a lazy approach to not teach your mind to try

This is why we are where we are. Most of the book we read, stays exactly there. The worst HOD I had was a management expert

We have to be better
6/8/22, 10:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I am unable to vote in the next election as much as I wish to
6/8/22, 10:43 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Your candidate is unarguably the best Nigeria can have now. However there are more to the process of emerging presidency than standing on the queue which must be done anyway
6/8/22, 10:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: You are getting it wrong. Picking up imminent challenge is not same as unwillingness to try
6/8/22, 10:44 AM - +234 806 876 9591: This message was deleted
6/8/22, 10:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Except if it same for you
6/8/22, 10:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: So I could actually say it will rain today and I don't feel like going to office
6/8/22, 10:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Doesn't mean I won't go
6/8/22, 10:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Do you get the argument
6/8/22, 10:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It will be unkind of my colleagues to tell my boss that I mentioned I don't feel like going to office so I won't come
6/8/22, 10:45 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I get your point, I know you'll do your part

But you're missing mine
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Tell me
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: May be I'm lazy to read and absorb you well
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Oya type short short
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I'm saying you have itemised the problems but you're not proposing solutions just isolating problems
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Better
6/8/22, 10:46 AM - +234 806 566 2895: This is already known
6/8/22, 10:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The solutions are with the players responsible to safeguard the polling center and ensure it is safe to vote.
6/8/22, 10:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: At our level we can only mobilize
6/8/22, 10:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But the assurance and safety of polling station doesn't lie with us
6/8/22, 10:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: So why identify them.
6/8/22, 10:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Let you and stakeholder of Peter Obi plan that
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Francis your problem is INDIFFERENCE😅

I understand it, frankly it's my belief that dug me out of indifference

You may not agree but it's what colours your outlook
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And mobilize local vigilante
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: On election Day
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: To local protect people
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Does this suggestion work for you now
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: So discuss it in the Peter Obi meeting
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's better

Much better, now how can you help?
6/8/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: That these are possibilities and there should be mitigating plan
6/8/22, 10:49 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Oh it has been discussed

There's barely anything here that hasn't been analysed
6/8/22, 10:49 AM - +234 803 097 7516: If we ignore risk just cos we are positive then we would be silly
6/8/22, 10:49 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And we won't be able to manage it when it hit us
6/8/22, 10:50 AM - +234 806 566 2895: No one is ignoring anything. That's naive

But we have to be constructive and train our minds to source solutions and use that approach in addressing issues
6/8/22, 10:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Perfect. So we would have had this discussion shortened by you earlier volunteering this
6/8/22, 10:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Bode, you concerned are planned for and we are working on it🤣
6/8/22, 10:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: We hope to do
1
2
3
To ensure Nigerians are safe to cast their votes
6/8/22, 10:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I asked for solutions in my first post. In order to see if you come up with something new that's helpful

That's helps everyone here prepare rather than discourage them about coming out
6/8/22, 10:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: With that you would have saved my day to be defending why that wasn't negativity
6/8/22, 10:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's your responsibility as well

It's also what I hope you realise
6/8/22, 10:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You've gained something
6/8/22, 10:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Odabo joo
6/8/22, 11:13 AM - +234 703 714 8734: He will be an easier candidate to defeat than PYO who was a real threat to team Peter Obi.
6/8/22, 1:05 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Please which political ward is little Rayfield, new government house
6/8/22, 1:06 PM - +234 703 714 8734: I will defeat Atiku before 2pm don go loose Primaries before 9am
😆😆😆

6/8/22, 1:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 🤣
6/8/22, 1:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: True
6/8/22, 1:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Obi is Nigeria's only hope. A tall order that must be crossed if we must have a country called Nigeria.
6/8/22, 1:22 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Thank god.

If not for Peter obi we could have been left between choosing Sniper and Cyanide 😭

6/8/22, 1:23 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Yahaya Bello tried
6/8/22, 1:25 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Beats me. Some people complain so bitterly, but when the opportunity comes to try something different, they do not. At the same time, they work so hard to discourage those who have resolved in their hearts to try. 
In all of life’s endeavors, some amount of healthy skepticism is necessary, but when skepticism becomes one’s MO, they start to come across as an enemy of progress.
6/8/22, 1:26 PM - +234 806 566 2895: As in, I can't imagine the weight of hopelessness
6/8/22, 1:27 PM - +234 806 568 3004: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/8/22, 1:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Crowd funding from the diaspora would be key.
6/8/22, 1:29 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is going to be a battle of warchests
6/8/22, 1:30 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Well said

The truth is that it takes a lot to care about this country.

Belief in a higher power is one factor, it doesn't guarantee it, it just makes it easier.

It's another thing to be passionate about this country when you can leave at any moment or you aren't living here. In other words, it's hard to adopt healthy behavior when you don't think you're at risk, when your risk perception is low (this is a nuanced statement)😅.
I won't say more
6/8/22, 1:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Nigerians will play the psycophancy card when an eloquent and properly groomed man speaks but when push comes to shove, they collect the money and vote the man with tremors
6/8/22, 1:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

The battle begins man

This would be a battle to outspend
6/8/22, 1:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/8/22, 1:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Narrow minded forgetting the have a future to leave for their children
6/8/22, 1:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: What we saw today again is the power of the resolve of the north
6/8/22, 1:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: *they
6/8/22, 1:33 PM - +234 803 097 7516: A reality which sounds like negativity
6/8/22, 1:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: As well as the power of money!! Even the good book recognizes it when it says money answereth all things
6/8/22, 1:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Baba no give my stance negativity coloration biko 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/8/22, 1:33 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
6/8/22, 1:34 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Easy pick
6/8/22, 1:34 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In line with Rolands submissions, beyond identifying the task ahead, let’s profer solutions.
6/8/22, 1:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️
6/8/22, 1:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Crowd funding and strategy is a must. And must involve All
6/8/22, 1:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 1. In country fund raising for PO can be challenging. Lots of people are going thru a lot. However we now have him on the ballot. Diasporans need to crowdfund massively while the various teams here need to begin to build the structures
6/8/22, 1:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This should be a no-brainer but ...
6/8/22, 1:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 100%
6/8/22, 1:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Transparency 
Accountability

It's better you donate the item
6/8/22, 1:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: These structures are evidently needed. PO is the best candidate but someone at the ward level needs to be able to explain to mama and Uncle in the village that PO is the candidate we need
6/8/22, 1:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Few of us have shown our allegiance as diaspora. Needed not to me mentioned. But can we all get committed on this. Not by recommendations. 

The few meetings I attended online thanks to Eric for sharing. They sounded convincing and I felt it worth my dollar.
6/8/22, 1:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This doesn't negate the fact that risks and suggestion be made where needed
6/8/22, 1:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Without mincing words, somebody must go from door to door sharing salt and maggi and Rice in the name of Peter Obi even if it solves the meal of the day or week.
6/8/22, 1:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In every ward and every council
6/8/22, 1:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Must start at every ward and the movement must be owned by the market woman, student, okada rider, tanker drivers, NURTW, Teachers, civil servants, professionals etc. The movt for change must be owned by All
6/8/22, 1:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I discovered in our HIV clinic yesterday those poorer persons all have PVCs but they're poorly

Some young persons hadn't decided to vote

Older ones were unaware

There's need to sensitize the grassroot.

The good thing is the other candidates are bad, and we have 9months to work

There are plans on ground for massive door to door campaigns
6/8/22, 1:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly
6/8/22, 1:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Morning cry for village hostel type of thing
6/8/22, 1:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: If a debate where to happen 

One will not show up.

The other one will be used to mop the floor 

Lol
6/8/22, 1:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We have to pay community mobilizers, using the polio immunization structures
6/8/22, 1:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Two will not
6/8/22, 1:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: One will need chair

The other doesn't know how to smile

They'll send their VPs
6/8/22, 1:42 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Well-done Bode as regards this and you must not give up. This goes out to All in the diaspora ( The Nigeria project is like building the walls of Israel while in captivity). We all can't be outside the country and think we have escaped. Our relatives are still there and what value and traction does the green card bring you.

I don't mind spending 💰 of a just course. Peter Obi is what every Pence, cent!
6/8/22, 1:42 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol🤣
6/8/22, 1:43 PM - +234 817 034 1232: He shouldn't bother debating their VP's if they will not come
6/8/22, 1:43 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We can exploit the Polio surveillance structure

Use community mobilizers to disseminate information
6/8/22, 1:43 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Rufai from AriseTV moderating
6/8/22, 1:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There is a lot of ignorance even in the urban slums before we even go to rural areas. Let me share an experience to buttress Rolands point
6/8/22, 1:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: There's serious hope my people, we just need aggression and organization
6/8/22, 1:45 PM - +234 803 097 7516: They MoH would consider it as Partisan.
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And predispose to non compliance
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think that strategy on how to speak in their own language is key. *All they think about is where the next meal will come from. Until you give them that meal and prove you can sustain it for them and their children, that is when they will understand the philosophy and die for you*
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While participating in a research activity I asked a lady living in a community in Nyanya if she had her PVC and who she was going to vote. Her response was that she had the PVC but didn’t know who yet and that when the time comes, she will find out the candidate and vote. I asked if she knew Peter Obi -and she said no
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: When the beneficiary is not interested in you Candidate
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Did same for another man whose highest level of education was a completed secondary school
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You may have non compliance of health interventions with time
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They all had PVCs but no idea who the candidates even were
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Captain Rochas Okorocha spoke Hausa Yoruba Igbo Queens English.... yesterday 

And still has zero votes 🤣

These delegates are not smiling
6/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We wouldn't go through them 

We just need access to community mobilizers we can pay. It was an example
6/8/22, 1:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It is not difficult to engage community mobilzers
6/8/22, 1:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Individual can volunteer
6/8/22, 1:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yup

That's the structure to exploit
6/8/22, 1:48 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: For these people I realized 2 things 
1. They are both disconnected from the value of governance and see no need to know who is in power or seeking to take it as it has little or no repercussion in their lives. They source their own water, probably figure out their own power source. So why bug dem with who wants to be president
6/8/22, 1:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: An eye opener.
6/8/22, 1:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 2. For both study participants, when the question relating to household income per week was asked both were under 5k per week with households numbering as much as 6 to 10 people
6/8/22, 1:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Tell me that these persons wil not willfully collect 5000 and go vote a candidate they know nothing about even if to just feed for that week
6/8/22, 1:53 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Diasporans ke..why are we shifting responsibility? We are going through alot, as are those in Diaspora. Their "alot" just doesn't have food insecurity and bad roads as part of it, they have their own "alot" that they are going through.  We can't start putting financial expectations on those abroad.
6/8/22, 1:53 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: My last point to buttress the need for structure is this: 
If APC and PDP has candidates for literally every position down to councilor level campaigning to win their positions, naturally they would sell the party. 
Labor party needs to not only campaign for Obi but find credible people to give the PDP and APC candidates at all these levels a run for their money. This will create visibility for the party at these levels.
6/8/22, 1:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You cannot understate the need for grassroot sensitization
6/8/22, 1:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: These people are looking for someone who will not only give them that 5,000 or much more but make it a sustainable income and this is why they have to understand that the wrong choice will give the 5k as a one off but the right choice will not just give them now but make it a sustainable future for their generations on born.

I have seen cities with just a population of 17,000 live like kings and smaller countries of just 5 million live better, and I ask myself what is wrong with us?
6/8/22, 1:54 PM - +234 803 281 3842: EFCC voided his 8 votes. 😉
6/8/22, 1:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Your point Is valid Sir. The emphasis and why it is necessary is the value difference. One diasporan gives $10 is a whole lot already
6/8/22, 1:56 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Additionally the diasporans have been clamoring for a change and a credible candidate. This is their chance to make it happen
6/8/22, 1:58 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes but even with the burden they have they still remit about $25 billion US dollars and this is just expendable income(5% of their net income). 

The poverty in the land is profound to make most citizens think clearly and beyond the next meal.
6/8/22, 1:59 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 25 billion USD every yr
6/8/22, 2:00 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Solid points
6/8/22, 2:01 PM - +234 810 006 7926: They can't even vote, a thing a PO or YO would have actualised easily!
6/8/22, 2:03 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: My present concern However is that The Peter Obi team should pre-empt external influence of the APC and PDP to foster disunity using internal elements in the labor party. They must figure out a way to resolve the labor party factional impasse. This is very necessary to allow the perfection of the crucible needed to forge a reputable Third force.
6/8/22, 2:05 PM - +234 810 006 7926: True ! A concern that must be sorted yesterday. PDP is afraid of PO and would still enter LP to cause kasala
6/8/22, 2:15 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Now is the time for Team Peter Obi to assemble the best political strategist and begin to plant structures at the ward level, polling stations, streets and markets, it's time to be detailed.
 Tinubu is an easier opponent than PYO. A strong VP can also get to work. Do not underestimate the level of his smartness, I believe PO will get ahead of them all.

6/8/22, 3:02 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Nigeria is divided into 2 groups, 
1. Career politicians
2. Regular nigerians.

Career politicians are a group of jobless people who have no other sources of income than their participation in politics, they live on handouts and money shared at the end of political meetings. Because they have no jobs or businesses to attend to, they are very available for politics and become ward excos and eventually party delegates. This group do not care about good road, education or health care, security or economy. They care only about money shared at the end of a political meetings, and as long as indirect Primaries is concerned, these guys will always go for the cash out. But their work is done after the party Primaries.

Now is the turn of nigerians with their one vote each, to judge between the candidates and decide where their votes should go, base on their conscience. 
Don't let the characters of career politicians decide an election for you. Nigerians with their one vote each will decide now

Not recent.

But it will still happen eventually 

Some will remain so as not arouse suspicion and destroy the party from within, while leaking out strategies to Atiku

There is a reason Fani Kayode is there too. To wreck party. That's his pattern
lol
6/9/22, 4:11 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This looks very recent. Buni is going for a second term I think, so it couldn't be an old video in his first term.
6/9/22, 4:18 AM - +234 810 006 7926: The chairman of the party that welcomed Obi is from the West and the other faction fighting him is his brother from the east. 

Okopi, Onuh and Chibuzor, Bode is right. The grand plan is to ultimately return power to the north. We are denigrating back to regional politics again unfortunately. 

The more reason PO is our salvage pathway to greatness. He was smart to have left the pdp, because if he had contested the PDP primaries, he wouldn't have been able to contest in the LP by the new electoral act.
6/9/22, 6:09 AM - +234 706 647 6470: ON PETER OBI

If morality, frugality and social media ratings are the criteria, Obi will be president but be not deceived, Labour Party does not have the Grassroot reach required for winning a presidential election.

A horse is a strong and gracefull animal but you can't ride it across an entire country like you can do a truck. Structures are the vehicle that carries your good intentions for the masses. Labour party has weak and limited structures with not much time and resources to remedy the gap. Moreso, Obi is not rich enough or disposed to funding a national structure.

Structures are like pillars, buildings are held by pillars while bricks only provide warmth and cover from the elements.

The social media crowd are the bricks. Minus structures, Obi may Labour but he will be OBI-lterated

Copied
6/9/22, 6:24 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Structures that wins general elections are the okada riders, market women, teachers. Once you have them on your side the coast is clear. PDP had structures and lost to APC that was barely in 6 states.

As regards funds, it is a beautiful thing PO is frugal and don't have the money to spend. That is the kind of President we want. Don't worry we will crowd fund his ambitions.

It's funny Atiku thinks BAT is an easy opponent, BAT thinks Atiku will be an easy opponent. Both of them forget PO. Buhari became president not because he had structures, but because he had a cult followership and people believed in someone they never really knew or did due diligence. Obi has that cult followership and it is growing. I cannot say same for Atiku and Tinubu. If the drivers, market women, teachers, NUPENG drivers believe in him and are tired of the current ordeal and door to door campaigns ensured, he is home and dry.

6/10/22, 9:28 AM - +234 706 815 1299: "Peter Obi has no structure,bla bla bla"

First they planned to disgrace him during the  PDP primaries,he left them.

They looked for anything incriminating to indict him,it didn't work.

They went to  ambush him into being their VP candidate,he replied,"the youth have taken over my campaign".

They then sponsored some confused beings who are his kindred to make it look as if his people don't like him,it eventually failed.

His strongholds mobilized all over the nation for collection of *Peter's Victory Card(PVC),* they sent their thugs after them,some deliberately  delayed the process and shut the doors against them  using flimsy excuses to back up their claims.

Can't you see that they are afraid of *PETER GREGORY OBI?*

But they still claim he doesn't have structures,he is only popular on social media ,what and what make up structures,are they not human beings?.

However,let me remind us that social media was one of the major instruments that brought Buhari to power.

*Vote Human beings across Party lines,* the era of voting for party is gone.

Peter Obi for President

Iam fully *OBIDIENT*

*#PETERISBETTER*
6/10/22, 9:38 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Structure is good, but they know he is a nemesis to them. This time Nigerians are ready to vote
6/10/22, 9:45 AM - +234 806 537 0692: It has been a Great discussions here on Political stands and affiliations ... It's exciting to see us analysing, discussing and permutating over the issues of our dear country!

Some things I will love to highlight from our numerous discussions:

1) It is ok to be anybody's supporter ... Be it Atiku, be it Tinubu, be it Peter Obi ... Nobody should be made to feel bad over their stands.

2) Obi has become a movement and it's a beautiful things to behold ... 

3) When people talk about or comment about LB not having structures or not likely to win the next election ... No need to fight them ... They have a right to their opinion and that should be respected while hopefully educating them to believe.

4) Am worried about some issues as it relates to Peter Obi and Labour party ... In the core North ... The average person on the street has never heard of Obi and doesn't know who he is or what he represent ... What structures are in place or are being planned to address this?

5) We have to agree that the core northerners usually come out to vote as compared to voters apathy in some southern state.

6) The 25% vote per state, I believe is still needed to make any winner right ... Then we should be working on that more for the Northern states for PO ... This is the issue that we should about and not fighting people's opinions.

7) The Northern agenda is REAL ... And the only reason why Atiku will be worried, is because he is not the best candidate of the North ... But they don't have another person for now.

8) A great Nigeria is very possible but will take some time to gradually come to light ... Let us believe in the possibility, play our parts to make it happen for the sake our children!!!!

6/10/22, 9:56 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I fear this too. I imagine none will pass the 25% in the oppositions' regions. If Kwakwanso don't team up with Atiku, the PDP flag bearer may face an up hill task in the North, especially Kano

6/10/22, 10:35 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In the north every state has a party a leader and there are unspoken rules to not cross lines as far as loyalty is concerned. 
However, even as it stands this way, at the regional level, there is a lot of politicking for who the party leader is for the region as this influences where certain party positions move to and by extension influence
6/10/22, 10:35 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Kwankwanso was and probably still commands the leadership of the PDP in kano while Tambuwal commands for Sokoto.
6/10/22, 10:36 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: However, tambuwal began to overstretch his boundaries to wrestle regional party leadership with Kwankwaso, a move that didn’t sit well with the kwankwaso team

6/10/22, 11:56 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Oh I just took a deeper look and saw fresh registrants. I am wowed by the numbers I see in two states on the high side - Borno and Bayelsa. While Bornos numbers can be explained by a “potential renewed interest in who leads the country coming from their over 10 yrs of persistent armed conflict, I really can’t put a spin on the same interest from Bayelsa. Could be the possibility of a Jonathan candidacy
6/10/22, 11:56 AM - +234 806 965 1788: I hope they have collected their PVC? cos it is not enough to just register
6/10/22, 11:57 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Probably yes
6/10/22, 11:57 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lagos is explainable at 640k. Quite honestly a lot more insight would be gleaned from a deep dive of these registrants by Age and by maybe highest level of education.
6/10/22, 11:57 AM - +234 806 092 4290: PVC not ready yet na
6/10/22, 11:58 AM - +234 806 965 1788: There should be a temporary slip na
6/10/22, 11:58 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I am also certain that these numbers could be deceiving if we assumed they represented the totality of indigent ethnicities resident. I can almost bet a bottle of Viju milk that the easterners account for at least 25% of the numbers in the north

 I have news for this group of people. 

Who you vote for is your endorsement for nigeria, when they come with their flaws, you will not escape the negatives of their bad leadership, you will be victims of the resulting insecurity and economic poverty, because they were your endorsement. The repercussions of your vote go with you personally beyond the election day.

Now, if you vote a good candidate and he fails to win, your hand are therefore clean and you are free from the evil repercussions of the bad leadership of the day, because they were not your endorsement.

This is why even if a good candidate get only one vote being mine, I will still give him my vote. That is how to separate yourself from the evil in a nation even when you live in it. Your vote for good goes ahead of you.

So don't vote just to win, vote to show your stand. Stand for good, not evil.

Your vote is your endorsement, your stand, your life. And it goes with you beyond the election day.
6/10/22, 12:52 PM - +234 806 092 4290: How are you free from the "evil" repercussion because you didn't endorse? Tell me who the current situation in the country is not affecting?

6/10/22, 1:08 PM - +234 703 714 8734: When that kaduna train attack happened, there was no class or religious difference, royal father's, government officials, commoners, students, doctors anyone. Same with the bomb attacks, and the road kidnaps. Anyone at that location at that time could be the victim. In this country, a serving minister died in a road traffic accident which was blamed on a pot hole. So what governs the selection of victims of bad leadership? It is true that everyone is generally affected, but the degree of affectation vary from person to person, some survive, some don't. When you have decided to live in a country, you just have to strongly wish it well for that nation, and do your best to ensure it. This is what the campaign is about.
6/10/22, 1:12 PM - +234 806 537 0692: When they say there is no structures on ground ... It is not a lie ... 

The question is what are you doing to put proper structures on ground?

Especially because to become president, the candidate has to have 25% votes from every state ... 

Let us go to work rather than throwing around toxicity towards an expression of genuine concern!

6/10/22, 2:22 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes

Peter Obi is really the only one with a more heterogeneous following

Lagos will be split

We really need to focus on voter registration right now

There's a long time before elections and so much can happen before then

The others can't increase their popularity, they can only buy more people. But Peter Obi has enormous potential to grow

So there's time for "structure"

Today NLC, gave their support and it will only grow.

What is key to avoid is having decided voters who decided a little too late. Because those will be Peter Obi supporters
6/10/22, 2:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Labour is doing what labour will do... You can follow their Twitter page to find out

But the work is currently being driven by the many Peter Obi support groups and they're making significant strides daily. Little by little
6/10/22, 2:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

Mashak your intention is to strengthen candidate abi🤣

Who is your candidate?

The gods want to strengthen him small

Just tell us
6/10/22, 2:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Mashak has a predilection for choosing the wrong candidates na😃

Although it's a good thing. It will hasten the total destruction of Nigeria
6/10/22, 2:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yeah 

North Central will decide who becomes the president next year.
6/10/22, 2:25 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The truth is that, if everyone who intends to vote can be registered, particularly southern voters, this could be an upset

But this current INEC move is challenging and requires all the strategy and influence we can bring to bear to checkmate
6/10/22, 2:25 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Is that a question?

You know you asked what they were doing and that's where I see the pictures of actions by the different state chapters
6/10/22, 2:45 PM - +234 806 537 0692: I am actually looking for structures beyond social media ... Social media is full of Emotions and Noise and the tendency to deceive!
6/10/22, 2:48 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Ant the use of social is not evenly distributed
6/10/22, 2:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

But there's also truth as well as lies, you just need to train yourself to recognize it

You can't discard it altogether, ask Kumuyi😜

But there are groups working, you can join the TBN group and participate. You may help in building those "structures"

What I've learned is to not expect to see but participate in doing what others expect to see
6/10/22, 3:05 PM - +234 810 006 7926: And this is why I said LP needs a voice , a fearsome spokesman who will be on the offensive. This is the role Lie( sorry Lai) Mohammed played pre 2015.

This fight can be dirty sometimes and you need to focus on issues at the same time speaking truth to power
6/10/22, 3:11 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Drs can organize Medical Outreaches in the outbacks and hinter lands and funded by the PO campaign.

Just as your meeting their medical needs your at the same time introducing him to the community gate keepers
6/10/22, 3:16 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

That's what we are trying to do in Ebonyi. Medical outreaches to encourage voter registration and sensitization

We need to not look to others to do this for us, because if Peter Obi wins, we all benefit

We need to start being the actors. It's easy to analyze and identify problems. Solving problems is very very hard.

We are naturally in top echelons of the intellect spectrum and can be valuable assets in any sphere. We just need to participate

I've mostly reduced chatting here because my work here is largely done. People realize the good in Peter Obi and have begun selling him to others

We just need to participate and it has to be more than status updates or debating over newspaper headlines

6/10/22, 4:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Hellis Amaechi *HOW ELECTION IS RIGGED!!!* 
(As written by Prince Neche)

One of The biggest problems we have are those of you who think that whether or not they vote, the election will be rigged. Those who think our votes don’t count.
Yesterday, someone told me “Baba voting no go solve anything, our votes no Dey count, person wey go win go win”…. That’s a lie, a big lie from the pit of hell. 
Our votes Dey count, and person wey go win fit no we if we no vote.

Rigging is not as easy as we make it seem, it’s a game of numbers… permutations and combinations for those that know maths.

Ok lemme explain it in clearer ways.
Let’s say a particular polling unit has 800 registered voters, on Election Day, 800 ballot papers will be sent to that polling unit because it is expected that 800 people will show up to vote.

Now if on the day of the election, only 150 people came out to vote, and out of the 150, 127 people vote for Lp and and 20 people for PDP then 3 people vote for APC, it means there will be about 650 ballot papers unused.

When rigging starts, one person can sit one place and thumbprint the remaining 650 ballot papers in favour of APC and when the result is announced, APC will emerge the winner of that particular polling unit.
That is how Rigging is done.

But imagine If this same polling unit with 800 registered voters have 750 people who came out to vote, and 650 vote LP, 71 people vote PDP and 29 People vote APC, when APC wants to rig the election, they will have only 50 ballot papers to work with and even if the thumbprint all 50 in favour of APC, the outcome of the election will not be affected.

That is how rigging works.

Truth is whether you decide to vote or not, a decision will be taken for you, and a vote will be cast in your name. And chances are that it will be in favour of someone who will enslave you and keep you in Pepertual suffering.
So why not get your PVC and come out to vote, at least you’ll be sure that the vote casted in your name was in favour of someone you would have Chosen.

Nigeria is on the brink of wreakage, and 2023 is our chance at getting it right. If we miss it in 2023, our next chance will be in 2031 and I’m not sure we can afford that.

 *So, I beg you in the name of whatever you hold sacred. GET YOUR PVC AND GET READY TO COME AND VOTE!!!*

Them go hear am. This election may be violent, bloody and there may never another like it in our history

Insha Allah I go dey that polling boot
6/11/22, 12:02 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Nigeria, my country.

It is the election year again and 2023 is not so straightforward like some have suggested. The competition is not going to be between Tinubu  and Atiku like many assume. 

If we pay attention, it will be obvious to us that  we will not have to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea. This time around, God has made it happen that we are not going to be sandwiched between a rock and a hard place again. There is a new kid in the block. 

2023 is going to be about Tinubu and Atiku on one side and Peter Obi on the other side; between the old ways of doing things and the new ways of doing things; between bankruptcy of character and true integrity.

It is between money politics and politics centred on sound principles; between those who want to keep dragging us back and those who want to make genuine efforts to pick the pieces of our existence and make a meaning of it. 

And the electorates are also going to be in two broad categories:  The first group are those who are ever looking backwards to the same political parties and characters who have brought them pain and broken them for two unbroken decades and more while the second group will consist of those who have learned that you can't keep seeking healing at the feet of those who broke you and hurt you. This group is looking forward. 

Friends, on a personal note, in the current political dispensation and among the frontline contenders  that our delagate system of democracy has thrown up for us, Peter Obi is the one whose value system resonates with mine. 

Therefore, Peter Obi is the man! While everyone is entitled to their choices, there is no person who is truly desirous of a change for the better in this country who would discountenance Peter Obi's track record. He represents the change that we have been asking for. My vote is one and he has it. 

This is where my money goes. This is where my voice goes. This is where my efforts go. It is silly for anyone to suggest I might "waste my vote" . The narrative of wasting one's vote itself shows our people lack understanding of what it means to stand for something. It is a vote for my conscience and a vote for good governance. I don't care whether he has a political "structure" or not. Structures are built, one brick at a time, and I represent one. 

Dear Nigerian youths, it is time for you to take back your country. Never forget the events of recent years when your voice meant nothing to your totalitarian leaders in democratic garb. You cried at the top of your lungs  but you were not heard. You were muzzled. You were shut down. All you asked for was good governance but instruments of state were deployed against you like common criminals. If you cast your lot with the same people who are ever willing to buy your future with a stipend, do not turn around later to scream blue murder when they bring you more misery. They have nothing to give you but misery.

If we are going to have a semblance of sanity in this space, we have got to do it differently. We have to stop recycling the same people and parties that have consistently brought us misery. Let 2023 be a referendum on what or who you don't want. You know them already. Never despair. Don't give up. Speak with your strongest voice at the polls and leave the rest to God.

The "Mr calculator" who represents a total departure from wastefulness in governance. Obi is the man!

When it comes to bribery, shishi, we no dey give!

It is a new day! 

NINYO.

6/12/22, 9:17 AM - +234 703 714 8734: It's happening. The Peter Obi revolution
6/12/22, 9:21 AM - +234 817 034 1232: <Media omitted>
6/12/22, 11:25 AM - +234 703 714 8734: ✔️
6/12/22, 3:12 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Peter Obi is a good man, one of the best presidential materials. But the hard truth is, no South Easterner can win a presidential election in Nigeria without the support of Northern Nigeria. This is not a curse, it is a statistical fact. If the majority of the good Igbos out there and Peter Obi's campaign team wants him to win the election, lets them do the following, it is not going to be a rocket science: 👇👇

1. Translate All Peter Obi's speeches into the north's two major indigenous languages; Hausa and Fulfulde . 

2. Buy Radio airtime in major Radio stations in the North where Peter's translated speeches, interviews and his campaign menifestos will be played on a daily or weekly basis.

3. BBC Hausa and VOA Hausa are very vital. Get in touch with them to be granting regular interviews with powerful influential northerners to be appointed as Peter Obi's campaign Directors in the north. Engage other  International radio stations such as Radio Deutch Welle (DW) and Radio Beijing with considerable number of Hausa and Fulfulde listenership.

4. Identify and engage popular Northern Nigeria Social Media influencers and bloggers like Northern  Hibiscus, Hausa-Fulani, Kano Online, etc.

5. Create physical presence through liason offices in key Northern cities. These offices should be functional and be effectively engaging grassroot political formations from wards, to LGAs and states levels to propagate the message of a new Nigeria through Peter Obi. 

6. A powerful Northern Nigerian Vice President should be selected from Kano, Kaduna or Katsina - the super 3 Ks in terms of number of eligible voters.  

7. Create a Shadow Cabinet with Shadow Ministers.. 
A Shadow cabinet doesn't have executive power since they are only executive members of government in waiting. Distribute key Shadow Ministries to the 3 Ks. This will create a deep effect in the political conversation in the North. The Shadow Ministers will operate just like normal Ministers, they should be given official cars and their job will include to criticize the original Ministers in the current administration - offering a better alternative to the unsolved problems of the current cabinet. Shadow cabinets are powerful opposition tools. This alone could place Labour Party as the main opposition party displacing PDP which is almost on its way to the grave. 

8. The North is Nigeria's most politically conscious region. We don't vote money, we vote interest. Protect Northern interest in Nigeria while ensuring a balance in the South. 

9. Supporters of Peter Obi MUST TRY as much as possible to avoid getting into Social Media wars and confrontations with Northern Nigerians. Stop the subs.... Northerners are your partner in constructing the new Nigeria. I've always maintained that the North is not in enmity with the South. Some evil politicians created a fake division. Peter Obi must expose that division and seek to be a unifier. Supporters of Peter Obi must have at least 10 or more influential Northerners who are partners in the rescue Nigeria project. 

10. Avoid religious misunderstandings. Respect each other's religious opinions. Religion should never be part of politics. It was some evil politicians that brings in religion into Nigeria politics for their personal selfish interests.

11. Protect northerners and their businesses in the south and vice versa. Extend friendly hands to make the south, especially SE a safe haven for northerners.

As a Northerner who believed in justice, equity and fairness, and who is well informed about the good intentions of Mr Peter Obi, I'm convinced that when given the opportunity and with the right and selfless people in his government, we will see the birth of the new Nigeria we are all dreaming of. Let's give South East this opportunity, I will volunteer to be part of Peter Obi's team in the north.

Peter Obi is smart, focused and one of the best presidential candidates. But would his campaign team and kinsmen agrees to and implement the above quick wins campaign strategies I outlined? Let's gets this message across many platforms until Peter Obi and his campaign team come across it!!!!

6/12/22, 3:15 PM - +234 803 097 7516: We need to tell ourselves the truth
6/12/22, 3:15 PM - +234 817 271 4735: That I can agree with to some extent
6/12/22, 3:16 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Though available data says Nigeria is 52% Muslim and 48% Christian
6/12/22, 3:16 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Really?
6/12/22, 3:16 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But same data shows that more than the 50% of the 52% Muslim are less than 18yrs
6/12/22, 3:16 PM - +234 803 097 7516: So if truly there won't be underage voting
6/12/22, 3:17 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The politics of religion will not favor the north
6/12/22, 3:17 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Interesting. I need to lay my hands on that data
6/12/22, 3:17 PM - +234 817 271 4735: It will.
6/12/22, 3:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: How ? When the greatest population are Less than voting age ?
6/12/22, 3:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Out of the 48% Christians about 40% are Catholic
6/12/22, 3:19 PM - +234 817 271 4735: You know very well that that age will be manipulated
6/12/22, 3:19 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And largely about 18
6/12/22, 3:20 PM - +234 817 271 4735: And there is little or nothing we can do about it at the moment
6/12/22, 3:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: There is always a way to accountability it may be difficult not impossible

6/12/22, 3:23 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I'm an electronic balloting
6/12/22, 3:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Your vote automatically goes invalid once your age is less than 18 as at time of vote
6/12/22, 3:24 PM - +234 817 271 4735: That's a great idea but too late for 2023
6/12/22, 3:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Definitely not for 2023
6/12/22, 3:25 PM - +234 817 271 4735: So that means that the work of getting Nigeria great is a slow one

There is associated history of poverty, hunger, insecurity, fuel scarcity, epileptic power supply, ASUU strike and severe inflation.

23years ago, he had similar illness cause by PDP that lasted for 16years. However, not as severe as the index illness.

Preceding the PDP symptoms were intermittent military rule which led to a poor performance status of the patient.

However, experts have recommended a very effective medications  to be administered daily commencing from 2023.

All doctors must prescribe *OBIprofen and PETERcetamol*

It's not business as usual anymore for them

Make everybody sweat

6/13/22, 11:26 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Atiku has the liberty of picking a southern Christian 

Peter obi has the liberty of picking a northern Muslim.


Tinubu has no liberty. This is why he will not be the next president of Nigeria

If Tinubu picks a Northern Muslim it becomes a Muslim-Muslim ticket. He automatically loses almost all southern votes. 
Northern voters would prefer a Northern muslim than a southern muslim

If Tinubu picks a southern Christian it becomes a Southern-Southern candidate. He automatically loses all northern votes.

Therefore Atiku and Peter have a better chance of winning.


Tinubu will not rule Nigeria. His candidacy comes with many baggage.
6/13/22, 11:32 AM - +234 703 714 8734: ✔️, NNPP-LP merger talks on going, I hope kwankwaso takes VP position and gives us a clear ride to victory.

🤔🤔🤔🤔

If he does ... It will be a sweet ride ... 

But I can't help wondering if he will not prefer to be the flag bearer instead!
6/13/22, 11:35 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Musings!!!
6/13/22, 11:37 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Will be a sweet easy ride.

But will be difficult for him to accept as per ego.
6/13/22, 11:37 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Great point ... The ego thingy is there!
6/13/22, 11:38 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
I don't think the average core Northern politician who has some clout would think he can VP a southerner too. But stranger things have happened
6/13/22, 11:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: That's good easiest route to be President
6/13/22, 11:39 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yup

Politicians rarely have the pulse of the masses. If not he should know Peter Obi is more popular and has a wider spread support than him

The VP will also play a role on who emerges president
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Let's just forget Tinubu 

That one no dey equation  at all
6/13/22, 11:42 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Abi?

If it happens good, if not we move

All I have seen in this Peter Obi na how God dey remove the crutches we keep grasping at

I was so confused. The oga went for presidential primaries and told his brother to catch space.

If he won primaries his brother can continue, if not, he will return for the position he bankrolled😂

If I remember vividly,a very close friend of mine then, said Dave Umahi was not even Martin Elechi's choice. To have this sense of entitlement that nobody else would have done it better in Ebonyi than you or yours, moreso, the ticket didn't come easy to you in the first place is dumbfounding.

 The interpretation of this by the courts, is a welcome idea. There will be no longer room for cross carpeting. You win your mandate in one party, you remain in that party until your term finishes. If at all you feel uncomfortable, then you resign.

Can she prove to me again how voting for PO does not make sense?

If she can only see beyond her glasses, she will understand, Nigeria's problems are way beyond her grey hair and comic caricature.

Her concerns are welcomed, her conclusions rather alarming!
6/15/22, 7:23 AM - +234 810 006 7926: A brief background to PO

He is the first Nigeria in Nigeria's longest democracy dispensation to win his mandate by the courts. ( At the time rigging was the order of the day. It was much easier to wait for another four years and try again than approach the courts. After he won he set the pace for lawyers and other politicians including BAT to approach the courts to help win stolen mandates and that was how PYO came in to win 2-3 states back from the pdp. He set the tone for the current off season elections)


He was the first to be impeached and did not raise a dust or media self justification, *he went to the courts to RECLAIM his mandate, and he won* as a sitting governor. And he completed his four years.


I can go on... 

Candidates presented by the LP for the national assembly will be
6/15/22, 7:43 AM - +234 806 566 2895: They can't be worse than what the other parties have to offer🤷🏿‍♂️😂

6/15/22, 9:21 AM - +234 803 281 3842: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. There are several ways to overcome the challenge she has talked of. If labour party wins the executive and doesn't have a majority in the legislative, then they have to form some kind of unity government.  Obi appoints some people from the other party to form his government.  They won't ensure that their party can't push such impeachment agenda without resistance. And this is just one option. There are other things to do. Plus,impeaching the executive is not as easy as she thinks.
6/15/22, 9:54 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Winning the presidency is not same as executive council

Governors constitute the executive council
6/15/22, 10:03 AM - +234 803 281 3842: I was referring to the federal executive..the president is the Head of the federal executive and he appoints the members of FEC

6/15/22, 10:52 AM - +234 806 529 3872: Peter Obi beyond being Igbo By Hamza Sani

Please don’t assume that you know Ndi Igbo that much. If you brought a Rochas or Ikpeazu today to govern Nigeria, Ndi Igbo will rather vote a Kwankwaso. The problem here is that Peter was governor of Anambra and never blowed his trumpet as an achiever but Ndi Igbo recognized his performance. But because this was known only to Ndi Igbo at that time is why his appearance at the national scene first got their endorsement before others started hearing about his story.

But don’t forget Ndi Igbo will always go for competence if allowed to make their choices in any circumstances and they have been right on many occasions. Ndi Igbo massively supported Obasanjo from the south west and under Obasanjo the economy was growing; Ndi Igbo were right. Ndi Igbo massively supported Yaradua, under Yaradua peace was restored to Nigeria and the economy continued to grow; Ndi Igbo were right. Ndi Igbo massively supported Jonathan because they believed it was good to support a minority to achieve fairness and under Jonathan Nigeria became the biggest economy in Africa even though the corruption in PDP became obvious; Ndi Igbo were right.

Ndi Igbo refused to support Buhari because those who had experienced his regime in 1984 knew he was not a good manager of the economy and Ndi Igbo being lovers of business understood how it will turn out. Not because Buhari was a northerner; after all they have supported Yaradua and Atiku before even though they are northerners. And the Igbo supporters of Buhari were as much passionate.

Seven years after Ndi Igbo rejected Buhari because of their understanding of how business work, they have been proven right. Today inflation is spiraling out of control and Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world with mounting debt. Dollars has gone beyond the imagination of Naira, insecurity is worst than ever imagined and the country is in total disarray.

Even take it back to 1967 before Nigeria’s civil war, Ojukwu insisted on restructured Nigeria at Aburi so that the country can make progress but he was termed a rebel. But almost Forty years after some people started insisting on the restructuring of Nigeria, including our amiable Asiwaju Bola Tinubu who understands the importance of it.

Meaning that on many occasions in our national trajectory Ndi Igbo have been proven right but for whatever reason some people hate to love Ndi Igbo and have sought to blackmail them with ethnic prescriptions because many a times they stand boldly for what they believed in.

Yet it is Ndi Igbo that goes everywhere in Nigeria to live, invest, build, develop and live. No other ethnic group in Nigeria does that. Even when they say it is because indigenous people allowed them to I tend to wonder why they are not allowing other ethnic groups and why I don’t see heavy Yoruba investments in the north and prominent markets and businesses of northerners in the west. They don’t invest in each other’s domain and don’t build massively in each other’s domain but they claim they are more one Nigerian than Ndi Igbo who are ready to relocate with their families and billions to Niger state to start massive agricultural businesses if given the opportunity and they may never return to Igbo land if the state remains peaceful.

Put it this way: Ndi Igbo like a thriving society and not Ethnic jingoism, they have eyes for prosperity and not tribe or religion, they are bold to even condemn their own as long as he does not meet the standard. If you want to understand better how they think, bring a T. A Orji as PDP candidate, Rochas as APC candidate and an Adeshina of African Development Bank as Labour Party candidate and you will be shocked that both Igbo candidates mentioned will fail woefully in Igbo land because Ndi Igbo will not support such characters.

Obi has a good record in Anambra but was not known to many in Nigeria because Obi does not blow his trumpet. Yet Obi has been supporting education in northern Nigeria, including places like Sokoto and Benue without making noise; that is his style.

Yet if you are to situate Nigeria on equity and fairness doctrine, south east absolutely merits presidency at this time and if Peter Obi where to be their choice he is one of the finest Nigeria can get at the moment. He is passionate  about Nigeria and he knows how Nigeria can be transformed, he has success stories both in private and public sector to show for his ingenuity and he is within the right age to undertake the task.

But the support he is getting is because those who know him knows his capacity to make a difference and those who are truthful to themselves, unbiased, not tribalistic and indeed God fearing knows that he stands out in this race.

But all power belongs to God and he gives rulership to who he wills as long as citizens make the right choices.

His proposal is beautiful. A peaceful northerner listens to more radio than  his phone. VOA, BBC- Hausa service or the fulfulde and other tribes Igala, Tarok, Idoma, etc are the virtual entry to these communities. And these stations are not under the control of the state.

The northern social influencers would also need to buy in and sell it .

He is a low budget charge and bail prophet that engages in spiritual deception, falsehood and treachery.

He once prophesied that Chimaroke will not win second term. But the man won and even served in the senate.

Mbaka is just a prophet for hire: a servant of Belzebub and Belial. Unfit to serve even Baal worshipped by King Ahab.

He is a spiritual misfit who somehow is still mysteriously wearing the white garment. Because poverty has been weaponised in this country.

Normally he is supposed to be derobed. But this is Nigeria.

He is filled with unclean spirits. These spirits lead him to prophesy that Buhari will change Nigeria for the better. Of course you can see the result now.

No one should pay attention this man who engages in falsehood again

Just give him money and he'll sing to whatever tune you play. That Buhari stunt he pulled, then the video of him coercing Peter Obi to donate money still leaves a bad taste in my mouth

The man is a pulpit 'gun for hire'. You'd think a priest being "charismatic" and deviating from the deeply conservative views of the catholic church would be a good thing?

This man picked up all the wrong things in the pentecostal church and left the good

He simply is a slave to money
6/16/22, 6:06 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Peter obi refused to donate because he knows the man is a religious hoodlum.

Peter asked him to show him a church project so he can complete it with his money.

The spiritual fraudster wanted cash.

Now he is crying that a stingy man will not rule Nigeria. He doesn't know that is exactly the reason why we are voting.

What is surprising (not surprising anyway) is despite his failed prophecies – a large crowd still listens to the crook

But then we have graduates supporting a bullion van crook like Tinubu and Ganduje the dollar crook (President and VP)who were both caught on camera in the name of APC as well the other crook in PDP.

He had no project. Just wanted free money and was saying the man didn't want to give to "God" 

Baba na liars crowd dey follow pass because they tell you bring this amount and your problems are gone.

NO APOLOGIES, PLEASE.
On Peter Obi’s supposed ‘Stinginess’....

Sometime in 2009, ‘Mr’(as he preferred to be addressed) Peter Obi, Governor Of Anambra State at the time, visited Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu and myself at Dallas, Texas. He came to deliver a get well message from Dr Goodluck Jonathan and was billed to attend a black tie event at the Dallas Marriot. Curiously, he flew into Dallas airport with one small carry on luggage which he insisted on wheeling around himself, and on getting to our residence requested to freshen up. He opened his carry on, filled with files and paperwork and a few toiletries and an extra shirt, when the Ikemba and I asked if he was expecting another item of luggage, and he said no.
‘Then, what will you be wearing to the event tonight?’, we inquired. Then, it struck him that he couldn’t show up in his casuals at such a ceremony. I insisted on taking him to the luxury men’s emporium at Nieman Marcus to buy a smart black suit. When we got there, he was busy doing the currency conversions. The suit that was a perfect match for him was a dapper Tom Ford suit with a price tag of 3,985 dollars plus tax. He did the calculations and told me ‘do you know how many students this amount of money can train in Nigeria?’ I reminded him that he was the governor, and for the caliber of guests expected at that evening’s  event including the mayor, senators and captains of conglomerates, he needed to be dressed in top form.

To cut the story short, he refused to pay what he termed that  ‘outrageous’ price for the suit and that was how we ended up at Steinmart where he agreed to pay a more acceptable price of 220 dollars, tax inclusive for a basic men’s suit which he was happy to wear to that evening’s event.

What struck me, was that as we were on the way to the airport to see him off for his return flight back to Nigeria, he reached for his pocket where he brought out an envelope of crisp hundred dollar bills. The amount in the envelope was 3,800 dollars. He said ‘ Anyanwu, this is the balance of the money I would have paid for the ‘Ford’ suit. If the label on the suit was ‘Peter Obi’, I am wondering if anybody in America will pay that amount for it. I have deducted the amount we paid for the suit we eventually paid for. Please use this balance for your Charity foundation to help those in actual need. I trust you will do so’. We all laughed heartily. Vintage Peter Obi !
The eventual beneficiaries of that Largese were Madam Theresa Agbo, a yam seller who was displaced when her shed was gutted by fire, Callistus Egbe who was bedridden due to illness, and needed help with the school fees of his young children, and the Mgbemena family of six who were thrown out of their accommodation (which we subsequently doubled to two rooms) because their breadwinner fell upon hard times and could no longer afford the rent.
In Life, You either live by your creed or you desecrate the mould by which the Almighty created you. Any progressive nation measures an individual by his values, not his vaults.
If this way of life is what  is derided as  ‘stinginess’ on the part of Peter Obi, then we all need to adopt this mould for a more sustainable and more humane 2022.

16 June 2022. then we all need to adopt this mould for a more sustainable and more humane environment.

6/18/22, 9:39 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The Peter Obi Tsunami APC and PDP are Underrating 

By Farooq A. Kperogi
Twitter: @farooqkperogi

Former Anambra State governor Peter Obi is inspiring a powerful, social media-enabled, youth-led political tidal wave that will radically change the contours of the 2023 election.

 But APC and PDP operatives, still inebriated with the overconfidence of the size and deep pockets of their parties, are sniggering at the suggestion that Peter Obi’s Labour Party will change the game next year. 

They comfort themselves with the mantra that there are no polling booths on social media where Peter Obi’s devotees form noisy cyber silos. 

Well, there is no opponent more dangerous than an underestimated one. People who are habituated to the politics of the past may dismiss it, but something fundamentally novel is happening. 

There’s an unstoppably growing corps of fire-up young (and not-so-young) people who are investing their time, energy, and emotions in Peter Obi. We have seen spectacular spikes in PVC registration and an increase in offline political mobilization, all thanks to him.

Three factors appear to be driving this. One, there is mass disillusionment with the quality and character of the presidential candidates of the two major parties. 

They are the same woefully familiar, recycled, unimaginative, self-interested, careerist politicians who are deeply invested in sustaining the dysfunctions that keep Nigeria in the twilight zone between life and death.

They mouth the same flyblown clichés, can’t articulate any grand visions, are indistinguishable from past politicians, have no commitment to any grand ideals, and are in politics to steal from the public till and dispense favors to cronies.

Peter Obi seems to be different. He comes across as down-to-earth, self-aware, committed to transparency and the demystification of governance, and as someone who invests considerable intellectual energies into thinking about— and offering solutions to— Nigeria’s problems.

I am dubious of the facticity of some of his more self-righteous, messianic claims, and suspect that he sometimes hyperbolizes some of the too-good-to-be-true anecdotes about his time as Anambra State governor in order to gain the applause of his audiences. 

As a scholar of rhetorical studies, I know that rhetors can sometimes feel an obligation to not violate the expectations of their captive audiences by telling stories that their audiences want to hear even if this means bending or sexing up the facts a little bit.

Nonetheless, compared to Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu, Peter Obi is a breath of fresh air.

The second impetus for the dramatic surge in Obi’s political profile is religious. Many Christians in both the South and the North feel excluded from the presidential tickets of the APC and the PDP. Churches all across Nigeria are drumming up support for Obi in protest.

 I think this is legitimate in the interest of representational justice, particularly because Obi isn’t some pastor with a predetermined agenda to advance narrow religious or sectarian causes.

Although Obi is a devout Catholic, he is thoroughly secular and, based on some of his speeches I’ve watched, has a deep understanding of the imperative of separating the sacred and the profane in the business of governance. 

The third driver of his popularity is Igbo resentment at their systemic political exclusion. In my April 2, 2022, column titled “Why Nigeria Needs an Igbo President in 2023,” I wrote: 

“The Igbo are almost in the same spot that the Yoruba were in in 1998. There is mass resentment among them. Several of them feel emotionally disconnected from Nigeria. And we all know why. Apart from the fact that they have never produced a president or vice president since 1999, Muhammadu Buhari has done an extremely poor job of husbanding Nigeria’s intricate diversity.

“The sense of alienation that a vast swath of Igbo people feel now has made several of them, particularly their youth, susceptible to the murderous wiles of the mentally and emotionally disturbed mountebank called Nnamdi Kanu.”

Some of the secessionist oxygen that sustained Biafra agitation has now been redirected to Peter Obi, and Nnamdi Kanu has now been pushed on the backburner.  While some people have put a negative spin to this, I think it is a golden opportunity.

 It shows that an Igbo presidency will solve the secessionist agitations and violence in the Southeast. For me, that’s a worthwhile reward for having a president who is Igbo.

Incidentally, in the April 2 column I referred to earlier, Peter Obi was one of two Igbo people I recommended as candidates for the presidency. The other was Kingsley Moghalu who sadly lost the primary election of his party.

I wrote: “The second is Peter Obi. In a March 25, 2022, article titled ‘Peter Obi: Applying to Be Driver of a Knocked-Out Car,’ I mentioned that listening to his speeches has captured my imagination. He appears to have a handle on Nigeria’s problems, and what I’ve read of his record as governor of Anambra State inspires some confidence that he isn’t just a talker. 

“I can’t speak to his cosmopolitanism and commitment to seeing all of Nigeria as his constituency. That’s up to voters to find out.”

If Obi’s political momentum holds steady until February next year and the election is free and fair, I predict that he will cause a runoff.

 If he leads with the youth, Igbo, and Christian votes (I know there’s an overlap in some categories), he will upset both the APC and the PDP to the point that none of them can win in the first round of the presidential election.

If he doesn’t win or qualify to participate in the runoff, whoever he supports will be the winner. So, an intelligent political party won’t antagonize him or his supporters just yet.

But there are dangers for Obi, though, should he somehow defeat the structural impediments on his way to become president. First, his devotees call themselves “Obidients” and demand “Obidience” to him. That’s horrible. They would be worse than Buhari’s BMC trolls. 

What is needed in democracy is critical citizenship, not “obidience.” “Obidience” in democracy suggests a surrender of one’s critical faculty, which is what precisely what Buharism is.  It’s the death knell of democracy.

Obi’s rise to political stardom is propelled by anger at the political establishment. That’s the literal definition of populism. Populism instrumentalizes anger for politics without being able to transform the lives of the angry in any meaningful way. 

Obi’s devotees imagine him to embody the solutions to Nigeria’s problems and expect him to wave the magic wand and make them disappear. As he himself admitted in a previous public appearance, Nigeria’s problems are structural and systemic and can’t be resolved with a mere change of the personnel in the corridors of power. 

If his presidency violates the expectations of his devotees, they will turn against him. In other words, he is riding the tiger of populism, and it will devour him when he dismounts from it.

6/18/22, 10:05 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Kwankwaso should understand than with Peter Obi he enters Aso Rock, as VP he doesn't lose his support

If Peter Obi even whispers VP, all him supporters go siddon for house😂

6/18/22, 10:06 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: For the same position and legally by the new electoral act can’t run for a different position in the same electoral year
6/18/22, 10:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is the part of the electoral act giving Machina strength even as rumors of APC presenting Ahmad Lawan make the mill
6/18/22, 10:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: People should deeply examine the new electoral act as several legal cases will come up in its wake
6/18/22, 10:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It’s partly why Wike too couldn’t be VP to Atiku asides the other reasons that are also valid
6/18/22, 10:08 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I want to believe all the parties have legal teams that have studied these documents.

6/18/22, 10:08 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Even the place holder thing is dicey in the new electoral act
6/18/22, 10:09 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There are conditions for a VP nominee withdrawing once presented. ESP as a VP nominee is also elected not an appointee

6/18/22, 10:19 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This can throw more light. One party will need to align and have its supporters key in to the other with maybe arrangements on how to share power. But an actual merger at this point is impossible legally
6/18/22, 10:20 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Obi should consider Attahiru Jega and make agreements with The Kwankwasiyya side to support him
6/18/22, 10:20 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They can still draw up an agreement like the CPC and ACN did

If he does it will be by a slim margin.


Atiku will sweep the North

Obi will sweep the South.

Tinubu will not be the next president

6/19/22, 10:34 AM - +234 806 529 3872: Doyin Okupe  made an analogy on Arise TV that has stuck in my mind since I heard it.

It captures the disconnect between our rulers and the situation of the common Nigerian.

He said that the Titanic was a big ship with many floors. So luxurious at the top deck that the first class passengers could easily believe the story that it was unsinkable.

The lower decks were packed with lower class people that weren't even counted when planning for lifeboats.

And when the Titanic started sinking, water started filling up from under the ship. The lower decks where the lower class were.

While those in the lower floors were struggling and dying, those in the first class cabins on the higher floors had no idea that their end was nearby, they were making merry in the grand ballroom with champagne and fine dining, still living the lie that their ship was unsinkable.

As the ship tilted and made irregular movements, they looked around them at all the luxurious fittings and despite all the signs that they were in trouble, they just didn't get it.

By the time they realized the danger they were in, it was too late to save themselves.

Nigeria is sinking, those at the bottom know it, while those at the top think it's business as usual.

6/21/22, 9:16 PM - +234 803 458 6288: Good evening chief
This is the statement of what happened in female orthopedic ward today

We were called to site a central line for Olowookere Olamide who was the only patient on the ward at the time.
When we got there around 4:30pm we meet the nurse on duty and told her what we wanted to do she came to the bedside and screened the patient.
After explaining the procedure to the patient and consent granted, we requested for a trolley from the nurse, she pointed the trolley to us and told us to go and carry it. We were surprised because most wards do bring the trolley to us but in order not to waste time because we already got a call from children emergency to see a patient, the HO willingly brought the trolley and we started the procedure and in about 20minutes we were done. We picked out all the sharps we used and discarded appropriately in the sharp box. We wrapped the empty kit with the drape we used and kept on the lowest shelf of the trolley and wiped the topmost part of the trolley clean and moved the trolley away from the patient's bedside.
We proceeded to document for the patient and was about leaving the ward when the house officer was accosted that she should go and discard the waste which we ignored and we left the ward. The house officer was the last to leave so the nurse went to block her way asking her to go back and discard the waste and when she didn't answer the matron locked the gate with the padlock.
As if that wasn't enough, she started shouting a rained alot of insults on her that I can't even mention to the extent that nurses from other wards came to plead with her to stop and open the gate but she refused, one  even offered to bring her attendant to come and help with the waste but she declined.

Defined as the seizing or detention of an individual coupled with a threat to kill, injure or continue to detain such individual in order to compel a third person or governmental organization to take some action. 
That nurse should be charged and disciplined for her uncouth behavior. Her actions are unbecoming of our profession and if this one is allowed to slide, it will set a very bad precedent.

6/22/22, 6:07 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Exactly. That's what should be done if the management is not able to handle the situation satisfactorily.
6/22/22, 6:12 AM - +234 806 092 4290: For me, why they want to go on strike is what baffles me. Is it for the patients to protest against the nurses are or for the government to tell the nurses to stop harassing doctors. Are there evidence of reports of such cases that have been left unattended to by the management? If so, why not carry out a peaceful protest to the management in front of media and demand immediate action?
6/22/22, 7:55 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Please how did this end?
6/22/22, 8:00 AM - +234 810 006 7926: We just need to focus and keep working. We still have a lot of work. Compliments or statements of Truth here and there but we must remain focused on the main goal. We have to move from mass mobilisation to get PVCs to enlightening those who already have their PVCs and make them see reason why they have to be obedient.

We would make history if only at least 70% of people who collect their PVC vote for the right candidate!.

More sensitisation especially in the outbacks and hinterlands in the north!

Well-done everyone.
6/22/22, 8:03 AM - +234 703 714 8734: ✔️
6/22/22, 8:17 AM - Paul Ashir: Good set of questions.
6/22/22, 8:40 AM - +234 803 458 6288: We're currently on the 2nd day of warning strike.  Meeting held yesterday between ARD exco and the board management. Resolution by ARD were:  Mgt. to set a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter and take appropriate action ASAP,  release a document within 4 weeks to specify job descriptions of different cadre of staff within 4 weeks and to revisit the matter in our July OGM.
6/22/22, 8:42 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Ok laudable steps taken. In my opinion and experience with Detailing job descriptions, it may not solve the challenge esp as literally every job description will have or should have “ other delegated duties” at the end.
6/22/22, 8:42 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: What may be very useful is a clear organogram that shows reporting lines and levels of hierarchy.
6/22/22, 8:43 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Additionally, the nurse in question should have been suspended while investigations are ongoing
6/22/22, 8:43 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Holding any person staff or not against their will is unlawful
6/22/22, 8:46 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The Nigerian healthcare system particularly hospital practice needs a revamp and repositioning.  It needs to be rebranded from a humanitarian non profit entity it has always been perceived to be to the Business entity that it actually is. Only then will management take Human Resource management serious.
6/22/22, 8:50 AM - +234 803 458 6288: I agree with you bro
6/22/22, 9:01 AM - +234 806 568 3004: This won't solve the problem.

Health workers need to have meetings and agree how they can work together. We need a new approach so that we see each other as partners in progress. 

Suspending the nurse will only worsen the issue. I'm not justifying the locking of the doctor but we need to tread carefully with this HR issues otherwise we will bring further disharmony.

If there is shortage of staff, we should agree in how to work together to bridge the gap. 

I agree that the doctor is not a cleaner/porter but neither is the nurse. That is the point I think the nurse was trying to pass across. 

Fact finding mission won't find anything new that has not already being said.

Issue is identify the main background issue, and then different health workers involved agree to work together. 

Let's be honest, it doesn't matter who clears the waste provided it's not considered as someone's job. Sometimes the nurses can do it and sometimes the doctors can do it. It's all about team work and necessarily superiority. 

The issue is that there is already existing tension between health workers for different reasons so every incident is a tick-bomb waiting to explode. 

My thoughts anyway.
6/22/22, 9:07 AM - +234 803 458 6288: You're right, the main issue is that of forceful imprisonment of the HO and  verbal assault.  That's I think we can build more points on
6/22/22, 9:08 AM - +234 803 458 6288: *where I think
6/22/22, 9:12 AM - +234 803 458 6288: She was held hostage for close to an hour
6/22/22, 9:12 AM - +234 806 568 3004: That is left for the HO to seek legal action if necessary. 

If the institution supports the doctor against the nurse, it will only worsen industrial harmony.

We need to handle these HR issues with wisdom and caution and not take sides. 

Well, I may be speaking from the point of a mediator and may not say the same if I was an ARD President
6/22/22, 9:14 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I know. She can sue the nurse but the hospital management should just issue a warming. 

It's about building long term industrial harmony and not just addressing the index case. 

We can continue to be at war. We need to find a way to work together
6/22/22, 9:14 AM - +234 803 458 6288: Lol
6/22/22, 9:18 AM - +234 803 458 6288: I get your point,  but in this case the lady is under ARD. It would be more appropriate for the association to stand for her first,  if she's not satisfied then take the next step. The ARD legal team is on the matter already.
6/22/22, 9:28 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Association must stand for her I agree. 

The hospital management I the ones to mediate and calm the tension.

6/22/22, 10:59 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I don't think health workers have clearly defined roles. For example should a nurse have been part of the team pre procedure, during the procedure or after?. What are the clearly defined roles as a nurse or SOP. What is same for the HA or cleaner.

Everyone who takes up a job in the Fed or State level should have a job description so you know your limits. Unfortunately this does not come with our appointment letters, so we assume roles we set for ourselves or the ones defined by our seniors.

For example, is it the role of the nurse to be part of the ward rounds?, Ensure vital signs are done?. Is it the role of the nurse to set up the tray for the procedure?, All these roles are not clearly defined.

It is a sound move by ARD to demand clearly defined roles, so everyone knows his or her limits. HO, SHO, Registrar's 1, 2 and consultants should all have their roles defined.

Is it the job description of HO to run samples?. All these are questions we must clearly have answers to.

Apologies to this shameful act is not enough, setting up committees without ensuring SOPs and job description are clearly defined, only worsen the problem.
6/22/22, 11:00 AM - +234 810 006 7926: * worsens
6/22/22, 11:08 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Suspending the nurse is the first step in preventing a reoccurrence. This needs decisive actions and no need parambulating on the sanctity of sanctions to be meted out. The CMD has to be decisive. Trying to play politics with his renewal or replacement as CMD will only makes things worse.

I don't expect you slap a doctor today and I expect all the other doctors to be working because of the patients. Once the the security of the workspace of one doctor is threatened, it's affects all doctors and ultimately the the patients.

We don't play politics with things like this in ARD. Unlike the NMA, where you want to foot drag. Incidents like these is unacceptable by ARD and irrespective of whose ox is goored, they will stand by the supreme resolutions of their congresses.
6/22/22, 11:17 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 💯
6/22/22, 1:05 PM - +234 806 568 3004: It's fine for ARD to act but going on strike is an extreme measure.

Just my thoughts anyway!
6/22/22, 1:38 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Holding a doctor "hostage" is unacceptable, but this is a case of disagreement between two professionals  working together to manage patients. The nurse locked the door against the HO because she wanted her to discard the waste before leaving. She may have her grievances but taking the law into her own hands, it's unacceptable.
However, for ARD to declare 48 hours strike, not because all other nurses are rioting and threatening doctors or for the fact that there are no resources to discharge duties effectively still baffles me. So if tomorrow an argument ensues between another doctor and a nurse and the nurse's fundamental rights are abused, then the whole nurses declare strike because of an unprofessional behaviour from one doctor? For me, this strike a s extreme and unjustifiable. If these are recurring cases that the management have been negligent despite official documented reports sent to them on different occasions, then I will understand.
6/22/22, 2:39 PM - +234 803 458 6288: You're objective in your submission. This just a trigger. There were quite a number reported cases that weren't managed well. Recurrent assaults of Doctors by some staff,  patient relatives and co. Reports have been send on several occasions but we're swept under the carpet. Your last sentence said it all.
6/22/22, 2:39 PM - +234 803 458 6288: *sent
6/22/22, 2:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Thanks for the clarification. I hope the management wakes up and do the needful to prevent escalation
6/22/22, 2:43 PM - +234 803 458 6288: That's our hope too
6/22/22, 3:02 PM - +234 817 950 7218: This is what Bloomberg, an international media has to say about Tinubu and Atiku 🔥🔥🔥

The fight against corruption has been a top campaign issue in Nigeria’s last two presidential elections, but the history of graft allegations surrounding the two main candidates means neither is likely to raise it in the run-up to February’s vote.

Front-runner Bola Tinubu, who secured the ruling party’s nomination earlier this month, was being investigated by the country’s anti-corruption agency as recently as last June. Three decades ago he fought a lawsuit in which the US government accused him of laundering the proceeds of heroin trafficking and eventually reached a settlement. 

Atiku Abubakar, his chief rival, brought tens of millions of dollars of “suspect funds” into the US when he was Nigeria’s vice president in the 2000s, according to a US Senate report, and was implicated in a bribery case that resulted in the imprisonment of an American congressman. Neither episode resulted in charges against Abubakar.

Spokesmen for Tinubu and Abubakar didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The next president will face a daunting challenge to turn around Africa’s largest economy. Falling oil production threatens Nigeria’s place as the continent’s biggest crude producer, inflation is soaring and more than half of the working-age population are either unemployed or underemployed. 

The local currency has depreciated steeply under outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari, falling from around 220 naira to the US dollar on the widely-used parallel market when he was first elected in early 2015 to about 600 naira this week.

Nigeria vies with India as the country with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty despite having a seventh of the population. Meanwhile, secessionists, Islamist militants and armed criminal gangs terrorize large swathes of territory.

Efforts to restore security and fix the economy alone will likely fall short because there’s an unavoidable connection between financial graft and government dysfunction in Nigeria, said Leena Koni Hoffmann, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London. Corruption “hollows systems out and cripples them from the inside,” she said.

Contrast with Buhari

The race will see the two wealthy septuagenarians mobilize impressive political machines built over more than 30 years pursuing power in Africa’s most-populous country. Voters in Nigeria are often offered cash, food or clothing to persuade them to cast their ballots for particular candidates. 

On the eve of the last election in 2019, two armored bank vans were photographed driving into Tinubu’s home. “If I have money to spend, if I like, I give it to the people for free of charge as long as it’s not to buy votes,” he told reporters when asked what the vehicles were transporting.

Tinubu and Abubakar have cultivated deep systems of political patronage, according to Hoffmann. Both men excel at “engineering and expanding political networks through co-optation, through channeling and redistributing money and positions and favors,” she said.

The IRS secured warrants in January 1992 to seize almost $2 million, according to court filings. While living in Chicago between 1989 and 1991, Tinubu had deposited more than $1.8 million into one of the accounts, before transferring large sums to another bank, according to the US government’s complaint. While disputing the US’s reason for targeting the accounts, Tinubu settled in September 1993, agreeing to give up $460,000 to the US government in exchange for the release of the rest of the money. Tinubu wasn’t indicted over the matter.

A report published in 2010 by the US Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said one of Abubakar’s wives helped her husband bring more than $40 million in “suspect funds” into the US while he was Nigeria’s vice president, including at least $1.7 million in bribes paid by Siemens AG. Abubakar and his then spouse previously have denied any wrongdoing.

Former US Representative William Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009 for taking bribes from American companies interested in doing business in Nigeria and Ghana. In July 2005, Jefferson told a cooperating witness that then-Vice President Abubakar had also agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for his assistance, according to the Louisiana congressman’s indictment. Abubakar has previously rejected the allegations, saying he had no personal or business relationship with Jefferson.  

Abubakar’s hopes of succeeding President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 were torpedoed when the EFCC declared him unfit to hold public office and a Nigerian Senate panel recommended his prosecution for allegedly diverting government funds. Abubakar denied the allegations, saying he was the victim of political persecution.

6/23/22, 12:34 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Peter Obi!

He paid Wike a visit today.

Commendable!

Peter Obi is a great politician.

He must have read The Prince. In that immortal work, Machiavelli observes, "it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves."

Obi left the PDP when the ovation was loudest.

Obi is a fox; Wike is a lion.

Shrewdness is the attribute of the former while the latter always relies on his strength.

Obi is not just astute, he is shrewd.

Obi must have read Chinua Achebe's magnum opus, Arrow of God.

In Arrow of God, a character tells another who prides himself on his strength and bravery these words of wisdom. “It is sometimes good to be brave and courageous, but sometimes it is better to be a coward.  We often stand in the compound of the fool and point at the ruins where a brave man used to live.  He who has never submitted to anything will one day submit to his burial mat.” 

Wike is brave but lacks wisdom.

He mocked Obi during the primaries. He boasted he would win the PDP ticket.

He denigrated other aspirants, particularly Peter Obi.

Obi took all his insults with his accustomed equanimity.

He didn't respond in kind. He didn't pay Wike in his own coins.

He repeatedly calls Wike his friend and brother.

Obi stoops to conquer. He went to visit Wike today.

That is a man who understands politics. 

He knows he needs the support of everyone. Friends and foes. Mockers and admirers.

Obi is a genius.

How he has handled Wike, Father Mbaka, Reno Omokri, etc shows he is a man of uncommon wisdom.

While Obi is embarking on visits of pacification, he still has his eyes on the people.

Again, I will quote Machiavelli.

"The best fortress which a leader can possess is the affection of his people."

Obi has the love and affection of Nigerians.

Even the PDP and the APC cannot deny this.

Yesterday, Godwin Obaseki acknowledged this obvious truth.

In every home, we have Obi-dient citizens.

They no longer talk about PDP and APC.

They only talk about Labour Party. They only talk about Peter Obi.

You just can't help but love him.

Peter Obi's eloquence is unmatched, his knowledge is cast, his integrity is unimpeachable, and above all, his character is amiable and convivial.

Vote competence.

Vote vision.

Vote capacity.

Vote integrity.

Vote Peter Obi.

And you will be glad you did.

One of my cousins living today could have died postpartum 3 years back at FMC Makurdi if I had not called the Senior Consultant on call. He wasn't even aware he was on call and wasn't even informed about the case. Everybody gave up on my cousin and were only palliating and waiting for her to die. It was a registrar I was constantly in communication with that advised me to call the Senior Consultant on call. The consultant took her back to theatre and addressed the complications that night.

6/23/22, 3:15 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Their hands are tied now. There is a court injunction restraining the INEC from concluding this month.
6/23/22, 3:18 PM - Paul Ashir: In this govt, court injunctions are probable restrictions.
6/23/22, 3:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your right, we live in a country that anything can happen.

I think this time is for our good. Let the registration ex. continue. The crowds are overwhelming, and the safe bet was to get that injunction, otherwise, the INEC wasn't going to extend it further.

Sometimes you can only get people and Agencies do the right thing by going to the courts.
6/23/22, 3:24 PM - Paul Ashir: I also hope the rumours of polling unit abi na registration unit in Niger is not true.

6/23/22, 3:57 PM - Paul Ashir: I knew you thought it was the state so I tried to look for the stuff I saw
6/23/22, 4:00 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Okay. Thanks
6/23/22, 4:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: INeC has debunked it

6/23/22, 6:01 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Even with the extension of the date, the machinery to carry the registration is not being provided, and I suspect that it is deliberate. 
What will it take for extra computers and personnel to be provided?
People are heading to these registration centers in thousands only to be met with nonfunctional, faulty, very few, or no machines at all.

6/23/22, 8:04 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes have a point though. We hope the overwhelming will of the people with prevail. INEC has nothing to fear. They are not conducting an election to return the president for a second term, most of the govs and senators are not coming back. So they have an opportunity to right every wrong perception.

The deliberate efforts should not in anyway douse the overwhelming will of the people. Vox Populi vox dei!

6/23/22, 8:43 PM - +234 803 281 3842: So ekweremadu brought sharp 9ja girl to UK as kidney donor to his daughter, but the donor was not a match. Sharp girl decide to report to UK police and seek asylum, when they wanted to take her back to Nigeria...This is a case of choking on bone from fish you paid.
6/23/22, 8:43 PM - +234 817 034 1232: At heart of Nigerian foundation lies chronic wickedness 

Wicked leaders and wicked followers
6/23/22, 8:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I tell you

Would he have fetched just one organ or several for future disease conditions?
6/23/22, 8:48 PM - +234 817 034 1232: This defence has been flying online

This is example of a wicked follower trying to defend a wicked leader

They can match the donor here before taking the donor out of the country. At least we do transplant here.

The donor in question didn't know she will be used as donor and her organ taken out. Hence she reported to the police.

But his unintelligent followers now want to blame her and make her look like a crook that she wanted asylum and doesn't want to go back to Nigeria 


While we blame wicked leaders. We should know we have wicked followers too
6/23/22, 8:48 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Who knows how many they have kidnapped before that didn't match
6/23/22, 8:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Paragraph 3 is very true
6/23/22, 8:50 PM - +234 806 566 2895: God

I hadn't even thought of that

Mehn this thing is so messy
6/23/22, 8:51 PM - +234 803 281 3842: It was more a case of paying someone to donate a kidney for his daughter.  While that is illegal by UK legislation, it happens in many places. Most donors are induced to donate. I think the girl was made certain promises (probably promised that they would settle her in UK amongs other things) but when it turned out she was not a match, the ekweremadus called the deal off and tried to return her to buhari's 9ja. The girl was just too sharp for them. She reported and sought asylum and put them in a mess. All these would not have happened if they had gone to zenith kidney centre for their transplant.
6/23/22, 8:52 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Hopefully let him remain in jail there at least he doesn't have immunity 

Just imagine this crook was still a deputy senate president 

Do you know he could have gotten away with it becauseof of diplomatic immunity and passport?

Anyway he spoke against Peter obi

So the gods are after him. The gods are working overtime 😃
6/23/22, 8:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ok I see

Regardless, a child wouldn't be that smart though

6/23/22, 8:53 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Fix healthcare no way
6/23/22, 8:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: As in eh😪
6/23/22, 8:54 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

The match was done here jare.

I can bet this 


It his media handlers that cooked up this part of the story to paint him as a saint

They're the reason we are where we are. It's time they all pay

Na the embarrassment just dey pain me
6/23/22, 8:55 PM - +234 817 034 1232: She is an orphan

From the information available 

But even if she isn't 

The man is a crook for picking the child

He doesn't have relative that will match abi?
6/23/22, 8:56 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Why you go dey embarrassed for the crook

Naija don cast na

Lol
6/23/22, 8:56 PM - +234 803 281 3842: You sef think wetin you dey talk. If a man like that wanted to harvest organs illegally, he would go to places with less regulatory oversight on transplant, not UK.
I think that maybe the girl was recruited through agents, but she was aware what she was going there for. She subjected herself for the testing. When she was found not to be a match was when wahala started.
6/23/22, 8:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Not for him? For my country
6/23/22, 8:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You're attributing too much to a child, say her relatives or guardians
6/23/22, 8:58 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Or even zenith kidney centre Abuja.. they just don't rate Nigerian healthcare professionals. Serves him right
6/23/22, 9:01 PM - +234 817 034 1232: This excuse doesn't hold water.

First we do matching here in Nigeria 

The senator would have done it before taking her out
 

Kilingdat can confirm this process


Secondly she is 15 and they inflated her age to 21 on the international passport

Third if you have the money you will not want to go to places that are less regulated. You will prefer U.K than to go to India
6/23/22, 9:02 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Same way they don't rate Zenith is same way they will not rate other places with less regulation 

I would rather do a transplant in U.K or Germany  than in India or China 

That is why he went to U.K
6/23/22, 9:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol
6/23/22, 9:03 PM - +234 803 281 3842: My brother, the poverty in the land makes adults out of children.  I have seen 16 and 17yrs old coming to donate their eggs for financial compensation. When they are refused, they would beg and give stories of how they need the money, etc. If u insist, they leave to another facility and lie about their age. Ask for birth certificate, and e dey village..its happening everyday. 25% of uni Abuja girls have donated eggs at one time or the other. So,I can believe that the compensation promise lured her to agree ..but,when she was not a match and they tried to return her was where wahala start
6/23/22, 9:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: A homeless child?

Unlikely but I get your point. It's possible they knew all that but unlikely
6/23/22, 9:07 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Which Abuja? many UniJos girls do this as survival strategy bros
6/23/22, 9:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes 

Thanks to Buhari pushing them to poverty and Tinubu who will come to worsen it subsequently 😃
6/23/22, 9:09 PM - +234 806 965 1788: This isn't about Buhari, this started before his tenure here in Jos.

Don't defend him na

6/23/22, 9:12 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Now na surrogacy be the new business..23years olds would have done surrogacy like 1-2 times and still looking to do again. They do it with the approval of their parents who even share from monies paid. They argue that its better than prostitution and It kinda makes sense. The country is truly becoming the poverty headquarters of the world. Families are really in dire conditions.
6/23/22, 9:14 PM - +234 806 965 1788: You don't mean it. Omoh this world is something else oh

It's a boy
6/23/22, 9:17 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes 

The surrogacy will decrease once Peter is the president 😃

This is backed by solid data

6/23/22, 10:00 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He cannot recover from this. This was a man who wanted to be gov of Enugu by all means, talked like a god and said PO does not stand a chance. 
20,000 pounds was recovered from him which he did not declare. His 4 children are resident in the UK.

Imagine if he became governor, organ harvesting would be the new yahoo yahoo. Like Chibi said, only God knows how many children they have tried b4 this.


You have moral derelicts contesting elections, with no mental capacity and emotional intelligence to even take care of their immediate families.

The Nurse who locked up a doctor, in ife, just lost the APC ticket for a state house of assembly for a state in SW.

These politicians are just something else

6/23/22, 10:08 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Quite unfortunate for him. So the nurse was a nurse-politician? I didn't know that. Did she lose before the incident happened or was the loss as a result of the incident?
6/23/22, 10:09 PM - +234 810 006 7926: She lost before the incident. Just imagine if someone like that becomes a HA member

6/23/22, 10:47 PM - +234 806 568 3004: She is not in deep shit bro.

 If not we'll handled, this issue will shut that hospital down.

It will be an ugly battle for supremacy between Doctors and nurses. Watch out for another strike soon.
🤔🤔🤔🤔
6/23/22, 10:48 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Should be anticipated, hence the need for caution in handling the matter
6/23/22, 10:48 PM - +234 806 092 4290: My thoughts exactly
6/23/22, 10:49 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The hospital management should know better and handle the issue with wisdom. 

The query was a tricky move. 

It's not every time you use the stick.
6/23/22, 10:51 PM - +234 803 458 6288: There's a rumour of strike already

6/23/22, 10:57 PM - +234 806 568 3004: So the hospital mgt couldn't predict these scenarios and act wisely
6/23/22, 10:59 PM - +234 703 102 6999: Happy birthday to you sir.
6/23/22, 11:00 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Absence of repercussions is the reason why a hospital will be on strike for no just cause and everyone gets away with it. 

There has to be a very solid reason for a hospital strike otherwise the CMD should be issues a query from the FMOH.

If the hospital was privately owned, wouldn't the CMD do everything to avoid 'preventable' strikes. 

We need more accountability in the health system
6/23/22, 11:02 PM - +234 706 656 2719: I don’t understand your point sir

6/23/22, 11:05 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Some strikes are preventable. 

Sometimes CMDs don't really care if there is a strike because there are no sanctions for hospitals that are on strike
6/23/22, 11:07 PM - +234 706 656 2719: But is the query appropriate or not sir ?
6/23/22, 11:14 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Appropriate but....not compulsory.
6/23/22, 11:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I am struggling to understand the use of appropriate and not compulsory in the same sentence

6/23/22, 11:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your playing politics With something that should be decisive. Are you suggesting she should b allowed to go Scot free because you don't want attrition between the doctors and other health workers?.

The Private Scenario you painted, wouldn't she have been suspended or sacked by now?

When people become lawless and get away with it, then you are only breathing a time bomb and ultimately the patient who voted for wrong leaders suffer.

6/24/22, 12:06 AM - +234 810 006 7926: When your wrong with video evidence, it is difficult to even defend in court.
6/24/22, 12:08 AM - +234 806 568 3004: The nurse will be pushed by a court. There is undeniable video evidence. Agreed!
6/24/22, 12:08 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True.
6/24/22, 12:08 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Sometimes it's not about right or wrong, but what can foster industrial harmony and keep the system working
6/24/22, 12:09 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I understand NARD needs to defend her member, and JOHESU will want to do same for their member. 

It's got hospital management to find a way to balance the tensions
6/24/22, 12:10 AM - +234 806 568 3004: It's for hospital management to manage the tension. 

My comments are from the point of hospital management and not fro the angle of ARD or JOHESU
6/24/22, 12:15 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Quite honestly, the industrial harmony we already know does not exist. This deterrent steps actually enable the process of uncovering the various spoken and unspoken grievances that exist for a more constructive and objective solution. What you are suggesting is tantamount to window dressing an approach which has not augured well for our systems. I may be wrong but this is my opinion. We should be willing to face challenges head on and address or profer longer term solutions.
6/24/22, 12:16 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The mere request by the nurses to have a non physician head the committee is a clear pointer
6/24/22, 12:16 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Add to that the derogatory remarks about his private practice in a supposed “ legal document”
6/24/22, 12:18 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I get your point on trying to ensure industrial harmony, which is plausible. But nurses will always have a thing to grind with doctors as the head of their facilities. What we can push for is been professional in our relationship with colleagues, other health workers and patients.

Obviously the job description of nurses in the facility was not spelt out. 

Even if the doctor was 'wrong', it was more grievous to have locked the doctor up. And I'm waiting to see how Johesu or NANM will fight this case through.

I still believe clear cut roles of every health care worker is key to been professional.

Who set's the tray for procedures?. Is a nurse part of the team for the procedure?, Who takes away the tray?. When such misunderstanding occurs what is the hospital policy for escalation?

I believe the query is in order and a suspension after she answers will prevent and reoccurrence. And going forward, roles must be defined and health workers work within the limits of these roles.
6/24/22, 12:20 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Last last human resource knows why they add to most Scope of work “ And Other responsibilities delegated”. 

We move!!
6/24/22, 12:21 AM - +234 806 568 3004: To uncover the grievances, call people for meetings in peace time. Both parties are battle ready, not time to such an approach. I respect your opinion though
6/24/22, 12:22 AM - +234 806 568 3004: They have a point from their angle. Get an independent mediator who is possibly not a health workers so that both sides have confidence in the panel
6/24/22, 12:23 AM - +234 806 568 3004: That was out of line sha. But the nurses want to fight dirty
6/24/22, 12:23 AM - +234 810 006 7926: It's already gone viral on social media. Citizens are eager to know how it ends. That peace time you envisage may never even be close.
6/24/22, 12:25 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Healthcare delivery work is team work. Sometimes there are no clear differences in some roles. 

The first thing is to see that all health workers are part of one team that is focused on patient care and safety
6/24/22, 12:27 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Still not too late but it we allow both parties 'go to war' we know where it will end. Strike and the n mediation meetings to calm everyone down. 

At that point, no body will take responsibility for the lives lost during the strike
6/24/22, 12:49 AM - +234 810 006 7926: If you don't have clear cut roles, people will have 'assumed roles', which is not effective as a team player. You can't even be sued, if you don't default in clearly outlined roles.  

When you don't have clear differences in roles sometimes, it is a recipe for disaster for the team.

Every team has a head with each member with clearly defined roles with one sole aim, the patient.

As Ag. POTARD of my center it was an issue I have always raised with my CMD at the time
6/24/22, 12:50 AM - +234 806 568 3004: 👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
6/24/22, 12:50 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Happy birthday Sire.
6/24/22, 12:57 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 🤣🤣🤣. Simple and educative. Thank you
6/24/22, 1:29 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I agree with you. For me, the query is in order. She needs to answer to it and apologize for her actions, before the management can sit both parties down to caution and call out for unity. Further punishment or forgiveness will depend on the response to the query. If the management is not able to address it amicably then the victim of assault can decide to press charges in the court of law which is also not going to be good for the hospital.
I am surprised that instead of NANNM to seek for peace they are trying to justify her actions by comparing it to previous incidents, which, however is ideal to be brought before the committee or management when addressing the current issue.
6/24/22, 1:37 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Nevertheless, this their defense mechanism may not be unconnected to rumours on what they probably have heard the doctors saying. Someone stated here that the "nurse is in deep shit", which means judgement has been passed even before the response to the query or the sitting of the committee. So they believe that the said committee is not calling for peace but to "deal with" their "own". As Francis tries to point out, it's time all health care professional find a way of working in harmony to meet the common goal. This "war" that goes beyond this hospital will help no one at the end.
6/24/22, 4:00 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly @14159348891

This has been a worry too 

Honestly I wish the red and green logo can be changed sef....since it APC/PDP has a touch of red and green

So that those in rural areas will not be confused 

That logo is the most important part of the campaign 

If the colour will not be changed ..then sensitization should continue in earnest 

Supporters should do well to use the logo mostly while talking about the candidate verbally

A lesson to learn from Ike Ekweremadu issue....

Nick Agule from UK wrote....

Ike Ekweremadu is obviously a powerful man. Spending his 20th year in the Senate of which 12 were as Deputy Senate President.

He could have used the time to get Nigeria a world-class kidney hospital but no! He didn't need kidney treatment so it was his least bother.

Things happen and his own child needed kidney treatment. As it is with President Buhari and everyone who has held office in Nigeria, Ekweremadu shamelessly took his daughter to the UK for treatment where he was going to be attended to by Nigerian nurses and doctors whom Ekweremadu and gang chased away with total neglect of the health sector.

But Ekweremadu did not go with his child alone, he took along a boy who was suffering hardship and pains from a Nigeria Ekweremadu helped to damage. Ekweremadu wanted to harvest this boy's kidney to save his own child. As fate will have it, tests performed on the boy showed his kidney was not a match for Ekweremadu's daughter.

Ekweremadu began to make arrangements to return the boy to Nigeria and obviously take another one to the UK. But the boy tasted and enjoyed the good life in the UK something Ekweremadu and his band of bad and failed leaders deprived him of in Nigeria. The boy saw electricity 24/7 (powered by gas from Nigeria), he did not need to start 'I better pass you generator' or he sleeps in darkness to the joy of mosquitoes. He saw how clean and beautiful the hospitals were different from the mortuaries will call hospitals in Nigeria and absolutely for free. He saw how efficient the metropolitan police were securing the neighbourhood and not the Nigerian police starved of funds by Ekweremadu and gang! The boy enjoyed rides on clean and efficient public transportation (buses, trams, light rail, underground tube, trains, boats etc) and not the okada, Keke and endless trekking in Nigeria. The boy was awed by the beautiful landscaped, trash free and green environment and not the filth he is used to in Nigeria. The boy saw food everywhere. He saw beautiful schools from nursery to reception to primary to secondary all the way to high school absolutely free. He saw that his dream of university education will be realised even if he has no money for fees and ASUU will not truncate his dream in the UK. The boy saw unemployed people paid benefits by Govt. The boy saw, enjoyed and liked the UK better than Ekweremadu's Nigeria!

The boy decided he was not going back to Nigeria damaged by Ekweremadu and gang! The boy ran to seek refuge from the metropolitan police. In Ekweremadu's Nigeria the police would have arrested the boy and dropped him in Kuje prison where for the next 10yrs he will still be on 'awaiting trial' roll. If the boy tried to talk he will be summarily executed and his body paraded as an armed robber gunned down by the 'gallant' police. Ekweremadu and his gang are above the law in a lawless Nigeria they have created.

Unfortunately for Ekweremadu, the UK is not Nigeria. He has exchanged his posh mansion in a highbrow neighbourhood in London for a police cell where he is being schooled in the act of rule of law something he is obviously lacking in his nearly 20yrs as a law maker.

Ekweremadu will have his day in court.

His victim will now enjoy life in the UK because it's easy to prove that if he returns to Nigeria Ekweremadu and his goons will go after him!

If Ekweremadu had done his bit to fix Nigeria, all this drama will not happen!

Ekweremadu and those like him who think they can do well when Nigeria is sick have just found out the bitter truth - no one will prosper better than Nigeria. If Nigeria fails, we fail with it!

In 2023 we have a unique opportunity to elect leaders who understand that our fate is tied to Nigeria's fate. We rise or fall together!

Go get your PVC today!

We wish Ekweremadu's child quick recovery hoping that now his case is public a donor will soon be found for him.

6/26/22, 8:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: If you still have relatives schooling in Nigeria and of voting age. Advice them. Their future is in their hands

6/26/22, 7:26 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I don't think so
6/26/22, 7:28 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Then the number should be more than this.
6/26/22, 7:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: How many registered voters were there in 2019
6/26/22, 7:30 PM - +234 806 965 1788: 2019 cannot be 2020 the figures should much more than this. I think.
6/26/22, 7:31 PM - +234 803 097 7516: There was 84 million in 2019
6/26/22, 7:32 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This is about 90m now
6/26/22, 7:33 PM - +234 806 965 1788: If this is true then many have not registered yet
6/26/22, 7:33 PM - +234 803 097 7516: We definitively won't have 170m Nigerian registered lol
6/26/22, 7:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: South-South has 12,841,279 registered voters

6/26/22, 7:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Obviously South East are not doing well
6/26/22, 7:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: North East has improved much
6/26/22, 7:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: South West too
6/26/22, 7:36 PM - +234 806 965 1788: We definitely cannot have every adult register but at least having more than 100m should be an encouraging number.
6/26/22, 7:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Check our demographic information first
6/26/22, 7:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But you can compare the two years now
6/26/22, 7:36 PM - +234 806 965 1788: The south needs to match/ close this huge gap really.
6/26/22, 7:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 2019 and 2022
6/26/22, 7:37 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Yes I get your point.
6/26/22, 7:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Every region has gone over one million added
6/26/22, 7:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Except South East
6/26/22, 7:39 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Even the 1m is a small number to have registered over  11month period since the beginning of the CVR
6/26/22, 7:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Compared to the noise around yes
6/26/22, 7:40 PM - +234 806 965 1788: 👌🏽👍🏼
6/26/22, 7:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Another thing is to check howany percentage of the register actually voted
6/26/22, 7:49 PM - +234 806 965 1788: This is the main index sef
6/26/22, 8:13 PM - +234 806 568 3004: North West🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Almost equal to South East and South South
6/26/22, 8:14 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It's a battle ground
6/26/22, 8:14 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Kano and Kaduna make up the larger percentage there
6/26/22, 8:15 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Kwankwanso and Atiku
6/26/22, 8:18 PM - +234 806 568 3004: Likely to align eventually for the Northern interest
6/26/22, 8:19 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Are you saying ganduje can not harvest anything there for Tinubu his guy?

6/27/22, 6:49 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Upstairs, jagaban is better. Anyway, we have the best on the table. PO 2023
6/27/22, 7:56 AM - +234 817 271 4735: You truly believe he didn't attend primary and secondary schools? I think he did, the problem would be that the age on the certificates would not tally with his birth certificate or age declaration as the case may be.

6/27/22, 8:21 AM - +234 806 092 4290: 1. Ballot box snatching
2. Buying of voters' conscience
3. Paying of opponents' agents to take unused ballot papers and thumb print them for their own benefits and also to falsify results
4. Using thugs to intimidate and threaten voters and oppositions' agents so they don't come out to vote and defend the votes cast
5. Using INEC to disenfranchise eligible voters
6/27/22, 8:24 AM - +234 806 092 4290: What's the evidence that jagaban is better upstairs? Atiku is better for me
6/27/22, 8:27 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 👍🏿 thanks for sharing
6/27/22, 8:36 AM - Paul Ashir: This is total voters in the nation. 89 million can't be new voters.
6/27/22, 8:38 AM - Paul Ashir: They forgot the diploma in Radiology 🤐
6/27/22, 8:40 AM - Paul Ashir: Gbam!!!
6/27/22, 9:00 AM - +234 703 013 1067: Abi oooo.......
6/27/22, 9:03 AM - Paul Ashir: https://newsonlineng.com/bola-tinubu-real-name-yekini-amoda-ogunlere-from-iragbiji-osun-state/
6/27/22, 9:03 AM - Paul Ashir: Is this for real?
6/27/22, 9:03 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Fake
6/27/22, 9:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: There is no rule that says you can't change name
6/27/22, 9:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: All you need is an affidavit and publications to that effect
6/27/22, 9:04 AM - Paul Ashir: What I am asking is this? Are the 2 names one and the same person?
6/27/22, 9:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Not true I repeat
6/27/22, 9:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Tinubu lineage exist for those who read history
6/27/22, 9:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: His mum and family were part of the slave trade in coastal Nigeria
6/27/22, 9:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And that's where the family made money from
6/27/22, 9:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: This is just a story from someone who hasn't read well the history of the Tinubu family.
6/27/22, 9:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: There are three true families of lagos
6/27/22, 9:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Tinubu, Kosoko and I can't remember the third
6/27/22, 9:07 AM - Paul Ashir: I'd take your word for it.
6/27/22, 9:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Ahmed was born in Lagos though they were truly migrants from where is today called Osun
6/27/22, 9:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But that was as far back as before slave trade
6/27/22, 9:07 AM - Paul Ashir: Did he actually not do any schooling save for college degree?
6/27/22, 9:08 AM - +234 703 714 8734: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 9:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Naka has told you the most likely thing
6/27/22, 9:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Any smart person can deduce you age from the time you attended school
6/27/22, 9:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: What Tinubu is truly hiding is his age
6/27/22, 9:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Not his certificate
6/27/22, 9:09 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Anyone can write anything
6/27/22, 9:09 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The name i bear today were not my birth names only one of them is
6/27/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: People who know me of then could as well come up and say I was this and that
6/27/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And how does that affect anything
6/27/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Nigerian constitution allows that my dear
6/27/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: So let me ask you. How does a change of name affects his career?
6/27/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It is his age he is hiding . Name doesn't change nathin bro
6/27/22, 9:13 AM - +234 706 656 2719: 👍🏼
6/27/22, 9:15 AM - Paul Ashir: So, if it was 1979 and he was 27 in this picture. So that means his age is correct 🤞🏾
6/27/22, 9:15 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I never believe social media bro
6/27/22, 9:16 AM - +234 803 097 7516: His handle know that age means nothing. So they use the negative perceived to sell the positive for age
6/27/22, 9:17 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It is called smartness
6/27/22, 9:18 AM - +234 703 714 8734: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 9:29 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Make we go ask people to register o
6/27/22, 9:30 AM - +234 802 802 0243: The right thing to do.
6/27/22, 9:30 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The present data not actually in favour of a better Nigeria
6/27/22, 9:31 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Premise for this statement?
6/27/22, 9:32 AM - +234 803 097 7516: He is asking me premise. Ok I go give you compound
6/27/22, 9:38 AM - Paul Ashir: Registration Centres in the community are usually full. People are coming out.
6/27/22, 10:28 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Good observation Bode
6/27/22, 10:54 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Each time I remember "AGBADO", I check if my PVC is intact. God, abeg ooo🙏.
6/27/22, 11:03 AM - +234 806 537 0692: People are finally getting it that it is important to get their PVC ... Unfortunately they staff are using the rush and pressure to frustrate, exploit even deny some people of their right
6/27/22, 11:04 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Imagine collecting 2k per person and fighting the staff doing it for free
6/27/22, 11:05 AM - +234 806 537 0692: With your money, you will still spend time ooo
6/27/22, 11:06 AM - +234 703 013 1067: Oh my God! The decay is palpable.
6/27/22, 11:19 AM - +234 806 568 3004: With a new leader, all this petty corruption will stop

6/27/22, 12:52 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The crook has resigned after being caught in corruption scandal
6/27/22, 12:57 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Who caught him?
6/27/22, 12:58 PM - +234 817 034 1232: https://gazettengr.com/in-explosive-memo-supreme-court-justices-accuse-cjn-tanko-of-being-irresponsible-morally-decadent/
6/27/22, 12:59 PM - +234 817 034 1232: His fellow Justices👆🏼
6/27/22, 12:59 PM - +234 703 013 1067: Chai! Plenty wahala for dead body
6/27/22, 12:59 PM - +234 817 034 1232: That is why he shamelessly resigned on health grounds

Which is a lie
6/27/22, 1:03 PM - +234 806 965 1788: His colleague simply raised issues concerning administration of the office. He was not accused of siphoning funds and he didn't embezzle any. So he the proper thing to resign if you ask me. 
His resignation will pave way for investigation and  finding solution to the the problems of the Supreme Court justices. It largely deals with welfare issues chief.
6/27/22, 1:05 PM - +234 806 965 1788: He is setting a good precedence.
6/27/22, 1:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: https://dailytrust.com/crisis-hits-supreme-court-as-judges-accuse-cjn-of-corruption


Haba mash he was accused of corruption na
6/27/22, 1:08 PM - +234 806 965 1788: That's the media for you. What specifically was he accused of?
6/27/22, 1:08 PM - +234 806 965 1788: What was the corruption allegation?
6/27/22, 1:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: He didn't 

We know why he ran away
6/27/22, 1:09 PM - +234 806 965 1788: What the reason(s) he did a good thing by resigning. We expect this to be the right thing to do.
6/27/22, 1:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: In the past, justices were nominated to attend two to three foreign workshops or training per annum with accompanying persons for reasons of age. Since your Lordship’s assumption of office, Justices only attend two workshops in Dubai and Zanzibar. They were not accorded the privilege of travelling with accompanying persons as was the practice.
“Your Lordship totally ignored this demand and yet travelled with your spouse, children, and personal staff. We demand to know what has become our training funds, have they been diverted, or it’s a plain denial.
6/27/22, 1:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Obvious the crook was diverting funds 

Because he didn't respond to this allegation
6/27/22, 1:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Nothing honorable about him

He has achieved his aim of re installing Buhari 

Because he didn't win 2019 elections...lol
6/27/22, 1:13 PM - +234 803 310 4903: There is no honor among thieves.
6/27/22, 1:14 PM - +234 817 034 1232: As expected 👌🏼
6/27/22, 1:14 PM - +234 806 965 1788: If the funds are diverted then resigning is better to probe the guy. How else will you investigate with the guy there? 
If the guy travelled on such trip as official then then he is wrong to have done that. But if it was not official, then I don't see the crime committed.
6/27/22, 1:15 PM - +234 806 965 1788: There is honor in resigning.
6/27/22, 1:18 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You are making it look as if he did us a favour by resigning 

His inability to explain the funds shows he is guilty 

Will rather take the sides of the 14 justices than him

That is the standard
6/27/22, 1:22 PM - +234 806 965 1788: This is your standard Chibi and not what obtains elsewhere. He didn't do you a favour by resigning but the prestigious office of the JSC. 
He is better accountable now that he is out of office.
6/27/22, 1:23 PM - +234 806 965 1788: If he is found guilty then he should face it and dance to the music. It's as simple as that.
6/27/22, 1:24 PM - +234 817 034 1232: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 1:25 PM - +234 806 965 1788: He stays as CJN you are bitter, he resigned you are complaining. Which way na Chief priest?  Are the gods not seeing clearly? 😀
6/27/22, 1:28 PM - +234 817 950 7218: So this Olukayode's work now is to install who?
6/27/22, 1:29 PM - +234 806 965 1788: He installs himself 😀
6/27/22, 1:31 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 😃😃

Happy he resigned 

So integrity can return to the highest court
6/27/22, 2:14 PM - Jireh: Yes, in other climes...

But in this country, a public official resigns when he has no choice.

He probably failed in the power play that ensued in the background.
6/27/22, 2:17 PM - +234 806 965 1788: I think he didn't resting because of any power play that ensured in the back ground. You and I know very well how the power play rolls in Nigeria when your own is the one in power. If he really wanted to stay in power he has the backing of the power that be.
6/27/22, 2:21 PM - Jireh: He had the backing...but I'd rather believe he lost it in this matter. 

It is un-Nigerian to resign due to ill- health or to allow a 'proper' investigation take place.

Moreso that elections are near and the judiciary will play a key role.

If he was still relevant to the powers that be, there's no way in Jupiter they'd let him resign at this critical point in time.

Even on his sick bed, they will still allow him to constitute tribunals
6/27/22, 2:35 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Setting the pace... Resign  honourable whatever the stakes.  Someone has to learn to do that. He has done that if not the first to resign from that office. Of course being 'un-Nigerian' has to stop one day and someone has to initiate this. 
Remember his tenure didn't elapse. That he resigned on health grounds is a good thing for the institution's integrity.
6/27/22, 3:37 PM - Jireh: While that is a possibility, it's a rather remote one.

Do his antecedents before now project him as one who's honourable enough to resign of his own accord?

There's more to suggest that it was a compulsion rather than a voluntary 'honourable' decision
6/27/22, 3:44 PM - +234 706 656 2719: This message was deleted
6/27/22, 3:47 PM - +234 706 656 2719: There is honour! Is honourable to resign

6/27/22, 4:02 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 😃😃

6/27/22, 7:29 PM - +234 803 458 6288: OAUTH NURSES COMMENCE 72HOURS WARNING STRIKE. 

Speaking with the OAUTH NANNM chairman Mr Olawale on Telephone made it clear the reason the Nurses are going on strike.

1. The panel set up by the hospital management to investigate the issue was 99% Made up of Doctors and NO single Nurse was on the panel.

2: That the Hospital Management issued a query to the Nurse and no query was issued to the Doctor involved which contravene the principle of equality and fairness.

3. That the Hospital management humiliated Nurses by Paying a deaf ear to the plight of Nurses on #NursesVictimisation. 


The chairman further said not only Nurses are embarking on this 72HOURS strike action but that other Profesional union such as Pharmacist, Laboratory scientists, With other Allied Health Practitioners have down tools to drum support for Nurses. 


The Chairman who spoke with me on phone thank everyone supporting this course as well. 


As at this moment of posting this update, the OAUTH nurses are currently on STRIKE Action with other professionals.

If he tables that, it will amount to lying under oath and may disqualify him. BAT is not who we think he is. If a man can be cryptic with no accountable background and inherited a popular Lagos Family name , all in bid to achieve his live long dreams of becoming president.

Nigerians must not make the mistake of voting who they don't know like they did for Buhari.

This guy is into a lot of controversies. Yesterday it was drugs, corruption, thuggery, certificate, Age etc. A man who will do everything it takes for his selfish ambition cannot be trusted with our votes.

Who remembers Funsho Williams?. This guy had issues with his female deputy then Kofoworola. Even the next male deputy. 

His interests comes first rather than that of Nigerians.

Everybody he think he has helped is for his selfish interests.

This Landlord of Lagos with his emilokan tendency, will personalize Nigeria. It will no longer be his cousin been gov of Osun state, or his wife been a senator, or preparing his son to be gov or Lagos, or his daughter as Iyaloja of Lagos. It will get worse.

His wife is not any better. If you can call a journalist a dog, as a senator, What will happen if you become the first family of Nigeria?

Let 'BAT' spend the billions of stolen / common wealth of the people and let them decide whether or not they want a continum of the current conundrum.

Heard he dropped out of sec. school in Nigeria and left for the US where he did some form of remedial studies  in lieu of the School cert to be able to gain admission into the Chigago state university.
However you are right about the primary school cert. It will give away his age, real name and place of origin. 😃

*How Atiku Abubakar started the Privatisation that made most Nigerians JOBLESS*

*Wicked People!*

To those who don't know how the current hardship and poverty in Nigeria started, take your time and read this. 

Then investigate the owners of the companies that robbed the country of her assets, those are the devils you were warned about

Read;
HOW OBASANJO, ATIKU MADE NIGERIANS JOBLESS.

A. NigerDock is the largest ship fabrication yard in West Africa sub region. 

When it was sold, its Ex-MD Engr. Nkpubre Okon, openly stated how "Mr Job Creator" ignored the Transport Ministry then to Open bid for NigerDock.

 Atiku's preferred bidder, 'Global Energy' that agreed to increase NigerDock's workforce from 4,800 to 6,000 as part of privatization agreement dismissed 2,200 immediately it took ownership. 

Jagal Group that took over after Global Energy lost out on power play also sacked 1,400.

 B. Nigeria Port Authority reform was purely contrived to grab landed properties. 

10,000 workers were sacked & 133 bids opened for NPA properties consisting of 68 properties in Apapa, 28 houses in Ikoyi.

The highest reserves bid was for a property in Ikoyi fixed at N390.4 Million.

 C. NIGERIA RAILWAY
Did Atiku forget how 7000 railway workers were sacked in 2005 without compensation to reduce its workforce to 6,300?

Another 1,260 were fired in 2006. When ATIKU and his Headmaster were leaving in 2007, they left ~N5 Billion in unpaid Railway pension arrears.

 D. FEDERAL SECRETARIAT IKOYI
In 2006, Babalakin's Resort Ltd acquired this 15 storeys prime asset overgrown with weeds from atiku and OBJ through a Development Lease Agreement (DLA) for N7.2Billion. 

A Court has asked Buhari to pay N54 Billion to Babalakin for that blunder. 

The DLA, dated October 10, 2006, granted Babalakin Resort Ltd a 99-years lease to redevelop the Federal Secretariat complex, that OBJ & ATIKU had  abandoned for 7 years into 480 luxury apartments. 

This was at the eve of their departure from government. 

The transaction was one for the road.

The DLA hit the rocks when Lagos State Govt in the interest of the public indicated willingness in acquiring the Federal Secretariat complex. 

LASG insisted it should be accorded right of first refusal since LASG is the Issuing Authority of the C of O, coupled with other reasons.

 Lets not forget Atiku was in charge of the economy and OBJ gave him free hand until Galaxy Backbone scandal happened.

 In 2002, first 3yrs of the Obasanjo/Atiku, manufacturing accounts for 6% of GDP. 

Nigeria's GDP fell by half for d first time in 20yrs. 

This was d year all textile factories in Nigeria closed down and unemployment was 28% within the formal sector alone; I repeat, alone!!

 In 2002, UN estimated that 70% of Nigerians live below poverty line compared to 48.5% in 1998 under a military rule. Life expectancy fell from 54yrs to 51yrs. 

Two-fifth of every child below age 5 were malnourished and only 50% of the 128Million Nigerians have access to clean water.

copied:-
FACTUAL REPORT ON HOW ATIKU  SUPERVISED THE SALES OF OVER 145 FG INVESTMENTS AS A VICE PRESIDENT !!!

Please any or all ATIKU supporters or his campaign structure are free to deny these submission with facts not sentiments.

“As Head of National Council on Privatization (NCP), from 1999, atiku dug Nigeria's economic grave for today's extreme poverty and unemployment. 

There were over 600 federal assets when Atiku's NCP started selling. 

Atiku  should tell us who bought what and what was left for the country when he left power. 

To who did Atiku sell the following companies:

Nafcon
Eleme Petrochemical 
Daily Times
Ughelli Power
Egbin Power
NICON Insurance
ALSCON
Transcorp Hilton Hotel
NICON Luxury Hotel
Sunti Sugar Ltd
NetCom House
Bacita Sugar Ltd
MM2

In 2007, Onigbolo Cement operating at 500,000 tonnes per annum was sold to Dangote at N1.7Bn 😂

To those selling Atiku, let me remind you of Senate public hearing of August, 2011 which succinctly captures how Atiku through retinue of cohorts, fronts, shell companies, ring fenced over 70% of FG's assets through a brazen daylight robbery privatization that he supervised.

This is nothing sensational. 

Its real life facts and all the Senators are alive today. 

The 2011 privatization Senate committee was made up of Senator Ahmed Lawan – Chairman, Senators Babafemi Ojudu, Philip Aduda, Mohammed Ndume, Ifeanyi Okowa, Hope Uzodinma and Mohammadu Magoro.

Lets look at Aluminium Smelting Company, ALSCON, that Atiku privatized. 

ALSCON which Nigeria built with $3.2 billion, was sold to a Russian firm, Russal, for $130million. 

As of the time of sale, ALSCON had received $120million for the dredging of Imo River, but was never done.

When the Senate Sitting of August, 2011 asked the Russian company the whereabouts of the $120million dredging money, the company's Deputy Managing Director, Vitaly Kuzrestov, said that the money has been used for Environment Impact Assessment." 

FG's Five percent share in Eleme Petrochemical worth USD27 million was never presented at the National Council on Privatization before it was sold to Indorama. 

Indorama recovered this amount selling Polyethylene and Urea to the entire west Africa sub-region in just 14 months.

The Atikulate Business Theory: Sell to yourself Government assets that leaves millions in penury, to set up personal businesses that provides for a few.

Atiku didn't employ the few hundreds he employed because he likes them, he needs them to work to preserve what he took from Government.

A man who supervised sales of over 145 federal investments as a vice president, without a thought for today wants to be president. 

He didnt revitalize them. 

He didnt resuscitate them. 

He sold them to whomever agrees to his personal terms

THOSE WHO STOLE YOUR 2015--2030 IN 1999--2007 ARE THE SAME THIEVES YOU ARE NOW ROMANCING TO COME BACK!!!

For how long will you allow a few to steal your future and your children's future and be giving you crumbs.

Look at 1999--2007 everything we  grew up to know were sold to themselves or the scrap sold for cash.

Nigeria Airways and their houses in GRA Ikeja, what happened to them? 

When we were growing up most of the houses in GRA Ikeja were owned by the Nigeria Airways and all now sold to whom?

Nigeria RE. 

The biggest re insurance company in Africa who bought it?

NICON Insurance who bought it?

NITEL was sold for peanuts and killed by them so that their investment in AiRTEL, MTN, GLO etc will yield dividends
NITEL House one of the tallest in Marina was sold cheap to former Speaker Bankole.

What is the Status of National Stadium Surulere? 

Millions was budgeted for refurbishment by the  sports ministry and nothing to show.

Compare that stadium to Lagos State owned Thunder Balogun stadium and the difference is clear.

Nigerian National Shipping line? 

Where are the ships? 

They disappeared between 1999-2015
NEPA after Obasanjo spent $16 billion, they broke down NEPA to several units and sold it to themselves and NEPA is still not efficient while Atiku's Mikano Generators is powering Nigeria & her businesses! 

Obasanjo/Atiku sold Port Harcourt Refinery to their cronies in 2007 and thank God, President Yar’ Adua reversed it .

All of these happened in the 8 disastrous locust years of the obasanjo/Atiku, Recession didn't just happen! 

They looted us into recession! I cannot stand and watch those who plundered the nation come back in 2023.

Stop praising and voting for individuals who took your future away and stop them from coming back to steal your generation away.

Nigeria has a population of 200million people we are told.

Our 2018 budget is 9 trillion Naira.

The Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria AMCON, the company that was set up to help the rich buy their debts, told us last month that, 350 Nigerians {out of 200million citizens} are responsible for 80% of AMCON's N5.4 trillion debt portfolio.

May be you did not hear that well!

AMCON said only 350 Nigerians borrowed N5.4trillion from banks, which they could not pay and AMCON came in to buy up those debts in other to save the commercial banks from collapsing.

To put that in perspective;
2018 Capital Budget is N2.4 trillion

2018 Recurrent Budget is N3.4 trillion 

Add both capital and recurrent votes and you will get N5.8 trillion.

But 350 Nigerians, out of 200 million of us borrowed that same amount, they refused to pay and government came round to buy the debts over through AMCON.

The corporation also pointed out that, out of the millions of BVN numbers with the banks, only 100 BVNs collect 60% of bank lendings. 

And this has left the banks with 13,000 bad loans worth 5.6trillion borrowed by "big men" who are now fighting to remove this administration so that they wont ever pay their debts!

Now, when they go to recover from defaulters like they did with Silverbird for example, the same cheated ignorant commoners are the first to cry fowl.

Some of the companies owing include:
Seaworlf Nig Ltd - 160billion
Arik Air - 300billion
Tanzila Petroleum Ltd 49.2billion
Resort Int'l Ltd - 36.3billion
Home Trust Savings - 25.75billion
Suru worldwide ventures - 24.4billion
Roygate properties- 23.26 billion
Ziglagsis network Ltd - 20.33 billion
Lexcap partners - 18billion
Anyiam Osigwe Ltd - 17.25billion
Silverbird - 11 billion
Wokson International - 5 billion

From the figures above:

Arik alone is owing more than the 2018 Ministry of Transportation budget which is N263 billion.

Seaworlf Nig Ltd, is also owing more than the 2018 Ministry of Defence budget which is N145 billion.

It's not rocket science which is a product of our contrived emotions not our lack of education is exonerating, encouraging and  emboldening them to make desperate attempts to come back o power! 

Enough of this madness brethren and sisthren!

May Nigeria Succeed!!!! 

COPIED!

6/30/22, 5:33 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup. He is waiting for Wike's instructions basically
6/30/22, 6:01 AM - +234 806 092 4290: There are lots of sides to this story. If this boy can stay in a mansion and get a visa for UK without interview, then it means those working in that visa office are compromised and have to be queried.
Nevertheless, the senator is still culpable. If he claims there was consent, he has to present the agreement signed and the boy's parents/guardians consent. He has to show evidence of payment of the said agreed amount which I guess if there was any payment at all, he must have used their usual method of payment without track'. And for him to choose a "street" guy, he definitely saw the boy as useless and saw his life as worthless and could have discarded him without any trace if something went wrong.
6/30/22, 6:13 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

My biggest issue is that it seems the boy was without a guardian, relative, family member for such a procedure

I find it hard to believe he wasn't told but then the consent letter should have easy to produce
6/30/22, 6:14 AM - +234 803 097 7516: You don't need interview for UK visa. It's biometric
6/30/22, 6:15 AM - +234 803 097 7516: You just need to go have your picture taken and submit the documents
6/30/22, 6:16 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And I understand Nigerian government just hired a lawyer for ekweremadu 🤔
6/30/22, 6:35 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Thanks for the clarification. That still means he has to be there himself to do the biometrics, or can it be done by proxy?
6/30/22, 6:36 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Trying to waste our money as usual. Doesn't he have his own lawyer(s)?
6/30/22, 7:13 AM - +234 803 097 7516: In Nigeria UKVI is not directly involved. TLS does the process on their behalf
6/30/22, 7:14 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I have seen TLScontact taking biometric machine to politician houses to have them captured
6/30/22, 7:14 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Nothing is impossible with Nigerians directly managing it
6/30/22, 7:14 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I have a friend with TLScontact and I have heard alot as well
6/30/22, 7:51 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I see. That means it's very possible he was kept in the mansion and treated like a prince as he claimed

7/1/22, 3:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: No

Just the first sentence 

One Nigeria is still a scam

We don't share same values

Let's stop pretending about that😃
7/1/22, 3:46 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The only man right now that can make us one Nigeria is Peter Obi but you won't vote him, yet you want one Nigeria

It's not claiming "sealed" baba
7/1/22, 3:46 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Your candidate stated we are one Nigeria. This is why I posted the comment. Does the prophet disagree with the gods?
7/1/22, 3:47 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Why you jump the first sentence na

Your agenda no go agend😃
7/1/22, 3:48 PM - +234 806 965 1788: What makes the 'One Nigeria' of PO different from the One Nigeria in existence?
7/1/22, 3:51 PM - +234 806 965 1788: 🤣🤣🤣 I have no agenda. Just reacting to the statement by credited to PO. He made the statement because of the mat inscription. 🤷🏽‍♂️
7/1/22, 3:52 PM - +234 817 034 1232: It is possible that people from your camp that did the Mat inscription 



Won't put it past you guys😃
7/1/22, 3:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I understand you. I only spoke because you said "sealed", like because Peter Obi said it, so it is. Meaning you value his sentiments that highly? 

My point is that you agreed with him. He is the one candidate who shouldn't preach unity, yet he does.

Even your preferred candidate hasn't espoused the need for unity, but I understand he's been trying to get a GED
7/1/22, 3:54 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Rolly this is my submission on the Mat saga

They are the ones

Even PDP has not descended to this depths


Mash wat do you say to this allegation na
7/1/22, 3:54 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You don't get me
7/1/22, 3:55 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Ged 

Lol
7/1/22, 3:55 PM - +234 806 965 1788: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/1/22, 3:57 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Noooo

It's one of the many PO support groups

Peter Obi has too many support groups doing too many things sanctioned or not.

It's a simple mistake to be honest and if not for some elements from the North making a mountain out of molehill, it should be a non-issue
7/1/22, 3:59 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Do you know the source of the pics originally 

You are underestimating these guys

Those APC guys are devious and can engage in reverse psychology 

No support group has owned up

Mashak who amongst your people engage in that set up
7/1/22, 4:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I have a fair idea where it came from

APC dey try but they're not that smart, case in point Bashir
7/1/22, 4:02 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Lol. I understand your support for PO. I value his sentiments that is true but some supporters are dragging him for saying One Nigeria simply because they don't believe it. 
He need to preach more of this. He needs to bridge this huge gap that exist between the SE vs North. This is what will earn him the northern support. 
Hope you understand my advice?

7/1/22, 4:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Preach to Tinubu to believe in one Nigeria first before Peter obi who has set a standards

Would like your thoughts on his utterance😃

Since it is evidence based
7/1/22, 4:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Why should they believe in one Nigeria? Because it benefits you?

It's easy for you to say one Nigeria. It's very obvious you haven't put yourself in the shoes of others

How would you feel if the south tried to latch onto power for 16years?

Also why is the north insistent on one Nigeria, is there something we don't know?

If you had a wife who was tired of you and willing to leave, how would you keep her, with a chain or with honey? *If you understand, you understand*

One Nigeria would only be believed in when people see equity not because Peter Obi is running for president or because people support him. If there's a chance of one Nigeria it's with Peter Obi. The rest don care enough and are scammers
7/1/22, 4:08 PM - +234 806 965 1788: 🤣🤣🤣 the prophet is making BAT popular by this post. Why are you stocking his campaign/supporters?
7/1/22, 4:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: No one will believe this 

But that mat, it's the support groups
7/1/22, 4:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Campaign not bribe oga

You can be this much in denial. An attempt to create awareness is not same as vote buying
7/1/22, 4:10 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Just answer the question 

You are deflecting

You said Peter obi should preach one Nigeria when he has never been against it

What do you have to say about your presidential candidate who doesn't believe in one Nigeria but wants to rule it now

When we say Tinubu is a crook it is because of things like this


We await your defence on this statement
7/1/22, 4:14 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Of course no body said this is vote buying. It is a campaign strategy. The statement of 'We no go give shishi' is not only about Vote buying. It goes far beyoung vote buying. Is it?  Rowland take it easy bros. This campaign will come and go. PO will become president one day but not 2023....until that time comes...
7/1/22, 4:16 PM - +234 806 965 1788: When did I say PO is against one Nigeria or preached against same?
7/1/22, 4:18 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You said Peter Obi should teach his supporters to learn one Nigeria 

Tor I now said what of Tinubu that doesn't believe in One Nigeria 

Why is this question hard to answer 

You must answer oo😃
7/1/22, 4:19 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Abi he is a hypocrite🤣
7/1/22, 4:22 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Happy birthday Ejiro

Remain blessed and Obidient
7/1/22, 4:22 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Yes BAT said so and he didn't deny it. He gave his reasons for saying such at that point in time. 
I have not heard anywhere he preached 'one Nigeria' since he started his campaign like some politicians always say. This doesnt mean he does not believe in the Nigerian dream. So this is politics.
7/1/22, 4:23 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Obi and his supporters have  reasons too

Lol
7/1/22, 4:24 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The prophet doesn't believe in one Nigeria 😃

We are just managing
7/1/22, 4:24 PM - +234 806 965 1788: I will refer you to the same article so that you can find the answers you seek. 'Go and Verify' prophet. 😀
7/1/22, 4:25 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Okay. That's good one to note from the prophet but not the gods speaking through him😀
7/1/22, 4:26 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol
7/1/22, 4:49 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Really poor Photoshop
7/1/22, 4:52 PM - +234 803 623 3688: Happy birthday dearest friend Ejiro(babe) you are so special and you know it. Enjoy long life dear!
7/1/22, 5:54 PM - +234 803 970 5650: Gaskiya, Mash you don't have good intentions for Nigeria if it's BAT you are supporting

You surprise me a lot

Having garnered considerable experience over the years at various levels both as a leader and follower, within and without, I wish to present myself for yet another opportunity to serve you as the *Chairman of the Plateau State Chapter of our noble Association, the NMA* .
I am determined to serve the worthy cause of our dear Association and all members wholeheartedly.

In conclusion, with your blessing, goodwill, votes, the wealth of my experience and the accounts of my stewardship, you can be rest assured of a

This is really nothing new
If you study this teaching very well you'll know it's only place is in the LAW not GRACE. It's steeped in transaction

Grace requires much more than 10%, it'll make giving all easy.

There were all too many holes in this teaching, if you're open minded but fear...
7/5/22, 2:53 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Open minded is key
7/5/22, 4:54 AM - +234 817 950 7218: https://twitter.com/channelstv/status/1543723037069041665?t=jG_9S6R3ize8l1uj1vPZMQ&s=08

I was happy when they eventually went on to talk about some issues particularly security in the SW and Kwankwanso unfortunately did not appear to have significant ideas about the issues

I heard he did very well in Kano but to me, he sadly appears to be just marginally better than Atiku and co

He seems to be a good politician and seems to know how to play excellent politics and to strategize, but I don't see him as a particularly good leader or to have any real potential to lead Nigeria anywhere significant.

This interview was a little disappointing compared to what I had heard of him
7/5/22, 4:57 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He should stop talking about Peter 

Besides it's only Kano and Jigawa he has a bit of influence 

He is not different from the crop of politicians though he is better than Ganduje at least
7/5/22, 5:00 AM - +234 817 950 7218: In fairness to him, the interviewer kept asking him about Peter Obi. 

They wanted to rope him into saying something like a blunder

Most importantly, they wanted him to categorically refuse to be PO's running mate

But he was wise enough to not fall for the trap

He tactically evaded it

YET..... They still went ahead to use a misleading headline

He is a wise and tactful man and it seems he's willing to be PO's running mate

But he's not a great leader with ideas or likely to do anything tangible for Nigeria
7/5/22, 5:02 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

He is a smooth politician sha
He won't change status quo
7/5/22, 6:58 AM - +234 706 815 1299: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 7:07 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I was disappointed as well and this is with Seun from Channels TV as host, imagine Oseni Rufai from AriseTV as host, he would have been less impressive still

Sadly, he may be overrated

I was also disappointed to see him peddle that northern agenda "north will not vote Igbo, because they'll split the country"

He's either a proper politician or rather daft. In any case, he has no business being president as he is terribly ignorant of the southern culture and lack countrywide appeal
7/5/22, 7:09 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I think he said he won't be VP as the north will not vote him especially with someone from Southeast as president
7/5/22, 7:11 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Your last paragraph though 🤣. Who amongst all Nigerian President so far does
7/5/22, 7:11 AM - +234 803 281 3842: And the South won't vote him as president..either way, he loses.
7/5/22, 7:12 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Aside OBJ no one
7/5/22, 7:12 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Has a view of both sides
7/5/22, 7:12 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Atiku
7/5/22, 7:12 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I believe Atiku does if I'm being fair
7/5/22, 7:12 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Country wide Appeal Atiku 🤔
7/5/22, 7:13 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Oh? I meant knowledge of southern culture
7/5/22, 7:13 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Country wide appeal, only Peter Obi come close
7/5/22, 7:16 AM - +234 803 281 3842: You share Dino's pan Nigerian rhetoric
7/5/22, 7:22 AM - +234 806 566 2895: No I don't - Dino says he's a unifier. That's a weak assumption based on his stated criteria 

Knowledge of southern culture, yes I have to admit he does, at least more than BAT or Kwankwaso. He also has shown anything to suggest he's an ethnic or religious bigot

My knowledge about Atiku is rather a bit personal, which I can't share here. I've known about him as far back as 1992
7/5/22, 7:23 AM - +234 806 566 2895: *not shown

7/5/22, 8:29 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I can categorically tell you that he is not willing to be PO's VP. He insists on PO being his vice. I understand his sentiments but it is time Obi moves on and look for another VP
7/5/22, 8:31 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Whats "understandable about his sentiment?"... that only the north are superior enough to be president? I don't understand
7/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 806 092 4290: No, so of the key sentiments he has presented to LP are the "structures" that NNPP has over LP and political experience in both state and federal level

7/5/22, 5:03 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Slavery is what it is-evil! However, I dare say that the white man has taken steps (however inadequate) to right his wrongs. Chattel  slavery was abolished since 1865. Furthermore, in the case of colonialism, all African countries have since had decades of independence from their colonial masters. So, the question is, what has the black man done with his freedom? We can choose to always go back to the past and blame the white man for all our woes. However, when we point a finger at them, the rest point right back at us.
7/5/22, 5:07 PM - +234 806 092 4290: In addition, the slave trade then we're largely achieved through our own brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and parents
7/5/22, 5:12 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Not to mention modern day slavery. In Nigeria today for instance, there are many house-helps, servants and domestic staff that are treated worse than the slaves were.
7/5/22, 5:14 PM - +234 806 092 4290: In addition to the fact that we are all currently slaves to our political, and in some cases, religious leaders
7/5/22, 5:15 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Infact, you just hit the nail on the head.

7/5/22, 11:16 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Our Obidient VP Sen. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed is a 46 year old Academician, Businessman and Nigerian politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives between 2003 and 2007, and was elected Senator for Kaduna North, in Kaduna State, Nigeria in April 2011 running on the Congress for Progressive Change ticket, with a remarkable record of the credit of sponsoring important legislation in a very short time.

Baba-Ahmed has four degrees; a BSc and MSc in Economics from University of Maiduguri, a MBA from University of Wales, Cardiff and in 2006, he successfully completed his PhD studies, earning the title of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Westminster.

In 2011, Sen. Baba-Ahmed established Baze University, an independent University located in Abuja, Nigeria. Using his studies abroad as a benchmark, he noted that the Nigerian educational system was "appalling". This inspired the birth of Baze University, "to contribute towards fixing the system in order for Nigeria to realize its potentials and address various challenges".

Sen. Datti is a well accomplished philanthropist. Among many of his corporate social responsibility projects; he built and donated two junior secondary schools with total capacity of 4,000 students. It is worthy of note that the schools have graduated over 6,000 students to date.

Pro-Chancellor of Baze University

Managing Director, Baze Research & Data Service Ltd

Chairman, Baze Construction Ltd.

7/6/22, 7:42 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Totally agree with you. I would prefer him to Kwankwaso if you ask me. Also would wish his temperament complements that of Obi.

Seems to have achieved a lot for himself and spiral benefit to the society.

LP would be a platform for him to blossom and have a wider impact.

7/6/22, 12:58 PM - +234 803 097 7516: you will know that the biggest output is Economy
7/6/22, 12:58 PM - +234 806 965 1788: And independent variables

7/6/22, 1:03 PM - +234 806 965 1788: He couldn't end it sadly. I expect who ever that is coming to continue the fight.

7/6/22, 1:04 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Insecurity/kidnapping came out of unemployment, poor economy, poverty. If you don't know this then you still don't understand why our might army general president Buhari failed even in security

7/6/22, 1:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Of course 

If your economy is good

Then security follows

There is a reason why Saudi Arabia is stable compared to Yemen

Poverty breeds terrorism and insecurity
7/6/22, 1:06 PM - +234 703 714 8734: The reverse insecurity, you need the rebuild the economy, and increase education

7/6/22, 1:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly I don't know why he is picking fault.

Not as if Tinubu is stable and lucid to answer questions 

If they have asked Tinubu his response will be to feed us cassava, Agbado and corn
7/6/22, 1:08 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Sure. Thank God you are coming home and believing too that we will live to see it. It's a win win for all of us
7/6/22, 1:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: What about Tinubu makes you confident he'll tackle security?
7/6/22, 1:09 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

By him talking about insecurity after 8 years...it is an indictment on the people he supports 

As if Peter is already commander in chief
7/6/22, 1:10 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Make I drop the one e give Kwankwaso 

The opening line eh🤣🤣
7/6/22, 1:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I was shocked he had the courage to even mention it😦
7/6/22, 1:10 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Arise news: 
How do you respond to the comment made by Rabiu Kwakwanso that the north will not vote for an Igbo man in 2023? 

Mr. Peter Obi: 
"The comment by the elder brother Kwankwaso is the reason why we have 100 million Nigerians living in poverty, 18 million Nigerian children out of school and about 52% of Nigerians either unemployed or under employed , because rather than vote for competent leaders, we will rather vote for incompetence due to a primitive belief of religion and ethnicity. 

Tell me, today you can’t travel from abuja to kaduna by road or rail, is it because someone from the south east is in charge ? You can’t travel to Minna by road, is because someone from the south east is in charge? Yesterday we had an attack by bandits on the presidential convoy, in Katsina, is it because someone from the south east is in charge? Show me where people are prospering in the north or south? What we have consistently done in this country is to hire vehicle drivers to fly airplanes as pilots instead of hiring qualified pilots. 

We have a huge problem and if you don’t know, this country will soon default on their debt servicing, schools are shut down, insecurity is everywhere, Nigeria is in a coma and when you are in a coma all you want is to survive,  irrespective of where the surgeon who will keep you alive comes from “
7/6/22, 1:11 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Lol. Roland. You suppose me too.
7/6/22, 1:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Politics of interest

7/6/22, 1:11 PM - +234 806 965 1788: It has always been
7/6/22, 1:11 PM - +234 806 965 1788: He will do his best I believe that.
7/6/22, 1:12 PM - +234 806 965 1788: I have been home all along. We live to see it

No wahala 

Everybody go collect

E go reach Everybody
7/6/22, 1:12 PM - +234 806 566 2895: No that's a poor answer

Buhari did his best and it was insufficient

Your supposed to be voting an improvement

You're voting a sicker man

What can YOU tell us about his security plans or capacities?
7/6/22, 1:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: <Media omitted>
7/6/22, 1:13 PM - +234 806 965 1788: If you can tell us to go and verify,  why can't you?
7/6/22, 1:15 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Another weak response. You obviously cannot justify your support of Tinubu and truly I don't blame you, there's absolutely nothing the man has given you to work with. Cassava and agbado are poor tools in an argument 

Honestly Mashak I personally believe you shouldn't talk about presidential elections or aspirants

You're supporting the worst candidate for this election after supporting the worst president we have ever had with you full chest

It's certainly makes your judgement suspect
7/6/22, 1:17 PM - +234 806 965 1788: I think if you focus your energy in selling your candidate you will do better. Attacking personalities will only damage your reputation and that of your candidate the more.
7/6/22, 1:19 PM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother that emotional manipulation will not work😅
If I'm attacking personalities which is fluctuant, you are attacking my future and my children's future with serial repetitive bad choices

But I guess, as long as it works for you, the world is right😑
7/6/22, 1:19 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Let me save my energy.
7/6/22, 1:24 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Please Tinubu has tried

Yesterday he added Ewà (beans) to the menu

At least youths will be saved from PEM
7/6/22, 1:26 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Everything about the man is poor but his hunger for power
7/6/22, 1:27 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’m trying to understand you @2348069651788 . I’m patient enough to listen to valuable points as to why you support your candidate. And trust me my mind is open. Let’s hear you.
7/6/22, 1:32 PM - +234 817 034 1232: E no go tell you

Lol
7/6/22, 1:33 PM - +234 806 092 4290: What do you want to hear than the fact that Tinubu is a strategic politician that knows how to get power through whatever means, and it is "his time" to be president?
7/6/22, 1:34 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 🤣🤣
7/6/22, 1:37 PM - +234 806 965 1788: No point engaging in such discussion here @14159348891 . I choose to look and pass.  Sorry sir
7/6/22, 1:39 PM - +234 806 092 4290: To be honest, if we are to follow the antecedent of Nigeria's elections since 1999, Tinubu is favourite to win the 2023 election, no t because he is the best candidate but because he and APC have the "structures" to rig election. In fact, I have discovered that Atiku can't beat Tinubu despite their own "structures". Contrary to popular belief that the North will vote for Atiku instead of Tinubu, APC will ensure they get the majority of Northern votes to remain in power. APC northern stakeholders won't want to handover power to PDP.
7/6/22, 1:39 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Mash why you dey vex na

This na mutual something fa
7/6/22, 1:39 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Too bad Sir. I was looking forward to either being won over or winning you over. Surely an extra vote will help the cause.
7/6/22, 1:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Tinubu will not be the next president 

We will have this discussion next year

This is a prophecy 

And very certain


The contest is between Atiku and Peter

One of them will win
7/6/22, 1:41 PM - +234 806 965 1788: There is no anger here prophet. 😀
7/6/22, 1:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Great
7/6/22, 1:42 PM - +234 806 092 4290: As such, Peter Obi's LP is the major threat to Tinubu becoming the president come 2023. 
The good thing is that the current movement will alter the usual political calculations for success in 2023 election
7/6/22, 1:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Without marshaling points, I’d just table this here and now @2348069651788 . You see we are at a point in the nations history where we are in dire straights. We are a sinking ship. What we do not need now is Managers. Tinubu and Atiku are good Managers and maybe to draw a parallel, Obi is too. However, Peter Obi is a leader and has since demonstrated severally his ability to take responsibility even when he has not yet been handed authority. Tinubu and Atiku are no Leaders. I wouldn’t delve into the nitty grities. What Nigeria needs right now is a leader not just a manager. 

I always forget to bring Kwankwaso into the fray......🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️ I actually don’t understand why
7/6/22, 1:50 PM - +234 817 034 1232: "The comments from Kwankwaso show why we are where we are today. We vote for Incompetence based on the Primitive Consideration of Tribe & Religion"

Peter Obi: "I can hire professionals to write something I don't believe in & don't even practice, just to win your hearts. If you want my manifesto, listen to me when I speak. Check my records as Governor.
When you hear them directly from me as you're hearing right now, it would easier to hold me accountable when I don't keep up to my words. Not when I hire professionals to put together things that I don't even understand"


Stray bullet for Atiku

The dubai politician🤣
7/6/22, 1:53 PM - +234 817 034 1232: "I need to know all before I become president, not when I get there, I begin to blame people. As a president, you are employed to fix issues and not give excuse"


Stray bullet for Buhari
7/6/22, 1:54 PM - +234 817 034 1232: "I am building a team of competent Nigerians. I want those who can look at me in the face & say; “Mr President, you are wrong.” I don’t know everything. So if you agree with me in 3 meetings, you go. That means u don’t have your own ideas"

Peter Obi..

Stray bullet for sycophants and praise singers

Kudos to you

7/6/22, 9:48 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Honestly, that is the thing that has always baffled me. It not like these people just vanish into thin air. These terrorists come in their hordes, operate for hours, and even kidnap hundreds of people at a time. Yet, no one knows their location. I believe it was Abacha who once said that “if an insurgency exceeds 24 hours, the government has hands in it”.
7/6/22, 9:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I honestly think  Buhari's tactic silence may be complicit. All these things happening is for a reason. He did not become president for change but an agenda only he knows and is becoming public knowledge. Where is he now? Senegal?. He probably stayed more days outside the country. He just came back a few days ago and he's away again. Those travels must be meetings behind closed doors.

All will come to naught with fraught

I met her at the time Buhari was newly elected. When she realized I was Nigerian, she said to me (with so much glee): “I heard you guys just elected a Fulani president”. Emphasis on Fulani.
That struck me as a bit odd. Why would a foreigner be so excited about an election in another country, especially about the fact that the winner came from a particular tribe?
At the time, I didn’t make much of it. Now, the picture is so clear.

7/6/22, 10:31 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: If Trump’s 2020 election defeat is anything to go by, then it’s a good idea for Christians to stay away from these “prophets”. These men do not speak for God. What they do is called cold reading.
Cold reading is a set of techniques used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, and mediums. 
Without prior knowledge, a practiced cold-reader (or prophet in this case) can quickly obtain a great deal of information by analyzing the person's physical and social characteristics. In the case of world events, they can analyze current trends. They then employ high-probability guesses, quickly picking up on signals as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not. After that, they then emphasize and reinforce chance connections. In the event that their guesses are right, people applaud them as God’s oracles. However, when the guesses are wrong, people (especially Christians) look for every excuse under the sun  as to why they may have been wrong, other than the fact that these men are false prophets.

7/8/22, 6:41 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Looser
7/8/22, 6:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Resigning would have gained him more sympathy under another platform
7/8/22, 6:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: He is walking his way into oblivion and forever irrelevance
7/8/22, 6:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Many more people would have resigned if only he was bold enough
7/8/22, 6:44 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

I don't blame him he doesn't have much power

I won't blame him for the current problem of this country 

He failed to resign...that is why I blame him
7/8/22, 6:44 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
7/8/22, 6:44 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I agree
7/8/22, 6:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He actually worked and tried to change the country when the crook Buhari travelled out

Those few weeks proved he could try at least

If he was on the ballot, would have voted him than Atiku.

But Atiku remains better than Tinubu
7/8/22, 6:47 AM - +234 706 647 6470: I feel for him.

He fell for politics.

He went in with an innocent good mind.

Why Innocent  good people should engage in politics early to learn the grassroots of political ways.

Be class rep early, student unions, have national exposure, regional political strengths and weaknesses, and the mathematics of interest and long term relevance.

He didn't.

He thought secular English and promises in politics is same as church English.

He was too clean and didn't learn how to be clean in a dirty world.

Perhaps they promised him presidency for continuity of Buhari good works

And he fell for it

And didn't resign
7/8/22, 6:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: He didn't strategize his ambition
7/8/22, 6:49 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Like GEJ his naivety cost him his ambition
7/8/22, 6:49 AM - +234 803 097 7516: He trust the words of the lips of Buhari and few cabal
7/8/22, 6:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Who verbally promised him a take over
7/8/22, 6:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Same way Kwankwanso is verbally promising the east lol
7/8/22, 6:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: That after eight years lol
7/8/22, 6:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: An experienced politician never trust another one
7/8/22, 6:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The interest is the only constant K in the business
7/8/22, 6:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And it waivers in a millisecond
7/8/22, 6:51 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Yeah...

Why he actually contested the primaries and was using the term continuity.

He thought politicians have conscience.

Little did he know that the conscience of politics is the interest they have.

No conscience in politics, just interests and long term relevance.
7/8/22, 6:52 AM - +234 806 329 9675: Atiku & Obi are likely going to go for a re-run election and Obi will emerge the winner at the end😜
7/8/22, 6:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: My brother this your prediction is not for Nigeria
7/8/22, 6:53 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Nigeria is a country with no need for a rerun for presidential seat
7/8/22, 6:55 AM - +234 803 097 7516: There would be no rerun. The interest of what matters. Like people were willing and did rigged Yaradua in. With out Obi consent and with a buy in from North (should it go stronger) . Some stakeholders won't risk to see their interest go down the drain . They would do anything
7/8/22, 6:55 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Even with the obvious possibility of him winning
7/8/22, 6:55 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Only a clean candidate exist . No clean electoral process
7/8/22, 6:56 AM - +234 806 329 9675: Hmmmmm

7/8/22, 7:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Imagine Osinbajo on Labour party ticket after resignation
7/8/22, 7:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I strongly believe Kwankwanso would be will to deputise him
7/8/22, 7:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Cos he know that a good number of North would yet go for Osinbajo in the polls than Tinubu

Fashola was the Obi of 8years ago

Everyone absolutely loved him, he would have gotten similar support

He went from that to a man that was finding camera at Lekki toll gate

Ministries taking away from him and failing to deliver in an incompetent government
7/8/22, 8:05 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly
7/8/22, 8:06 AM - +234 806 566 2895: No no no

Kwankwaso is high on own cool aid

He's been listening to sychophants that make him believe he's more influential than he is
7/8/22, 8:07 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's truly better to resign when you see things aren't working and you can't be effective than collecting salary wey you no need
7/8/22, 8:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The end of Tinubu boys.
7/8/22, 8:10 AM - +234 817 950 7218: After that his interview his rep just went wayyy down in the rest of the country

And he was smiling while misyarning

It's a pity sha


He really missed an opportunity to grow in the Nigerian political scene and I really thought he was wiser than that


Especially considering the fact that a northerner is currently in power

How can he justify his ambition, even if he actually did have a national presence

All in all the man has been a very big disappointment

His decision making has been very very poor
7/8/22, 8:11 AM - +234 817 950 7218: But of course, having immense support doesn't mean you are smart

Buhari had immense support and a movement in the north after all
7/8/22, 8:12 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Same with Osibanjo, they thought they will be made president.

The idea behind SW supporting Buhari was that power will then shift to them after he finishes

Both Fashola and Osibanjo where hoping to be that person
7/8/22, 8:12 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup
7/8/22, 8:14 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

You know sometimes you never know how much dross is in your head till your mouth opens

I daresay that Kwankwaso if he agreed to deputise Peter Obi would have undermined him in government if they won. Simply because of his lust for power 

They analyzed his influence on TVC, that he's a one state politicians, Kano and probably Jigawa due to proximity. But all the candidates he's supported in the last few years lost elections, even at local government levels

They placed a bet that he would win more than one state😅. One analyst even said none

Kwankwaso was just too arrogant
7/8/22, 8:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very very true
7/8/22, 8:16 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Fashola didn't seem to be that ambitious, at least judging from his body language but Osinbajo truly hoped

I was surprised Buhari didn't know back him
7/8/22, 8:25 AM - +234 806 566 2895: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 8:28 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yeah. He might win Kano by a small margin. Ganduje and Tinubu's millions will give him a run for his money
7/8/22, 8:29 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Fashola wanted it

But he wasn't going to go against Tinubu

He was hoping Tinubu will give it to him

If Tinubu wins, Fashola will still be very prominent in his cabinet
7/8/22, 8:32 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very correct
7/8/22, 8:32 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Okay
7/8/22, 8:36 AM - +234 703 714 8734: <Media omitted>
7/8/22, 10:56 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Yes, and by so doing, he became complicit in the affairs of this administration. That alone has forever tainted his reputation and casts him as a weak willed individual.
7/8/22, 11:01 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: That was the final nail in the coffin. How could he stand and preach “continuity to Nigerians in the face of all that is happening? So tone deaf.
7/8/22, 11:15 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Sound and prepared to take us out of the woods
7/8/22, 11:19 AM - +234 810 006 7926: We cock has finally come to roost
7/8/22, 11:19 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Perhaps Nigerians put Osibanjo on too high of a pedestal. There’s a saying that: “when a person shows you who they are; believe them”
By all his actions, Osinbanjo showed us his real character. Despite all the hype about his integrity, he failed to display it when it truly mattered. Worst of all, he named the name of Christ but was too fearful (and I dare say greedy) to depart from evil. He stuck with this evil administration until it lead to his political demise. I only pray that his soul is still redeemable.
7/8/22, 11:25 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This was Tinubu's selfish Idea and not south West. PDP shortchanged the SE it's fulcrum and the South easterners didn't support their own.
7/8/22, 11:45 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True!.
7/8/22, 12:21 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Every Nigerian must be OBIdient and YUSful

At face value it looks like hate

But if you look deeper you see they do have a point

Such things have the propensity to instigate violence

Especially for two groups who already don't get along so well

Trying to insinuate that PO subtly insulted their beloved Kwankwanso can cause some unrest

Same thing he did with circulating that praying mat with PO's picture

His intention is to make PO lose support but the effect might be violence

It certainly does have that potential
7/8/22, 3:45 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I didn't see anyone Northern there o

7/8/22, 3:48 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Actually this is true

Reno has been trying to instigate violence between the North and south

For someone who cannot write in hausa language and is using Google translate to translate his posts....something he has not done in years.


His account should be blocked Actually 


The petition is in order after reviewing both arguments
7/8/22, 3:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Only him bro

7/8/22, 3:50 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Like I’ve always said. Freedom of speech is a double edged sword. It can be used for both good and harm. However, it must still be encouraged and protected.
Every human being has the right to express their opinions as they please. However, every person must realize that they carry the responsibility for their words. 
Limiting free speech to only “useful /positive opinions”destroys the entire idea of FREE speech. Furthermore, it raises the question of “who is the arbiter of what is useful, positive, or correct”?
As humans, we all have divergent perspectives of what is right and wrong. These are influenced by our life experiences and a host of other factors. What may be positive for one group may not be for another. Expressing an opinion in a manner that does not cause harm or pain to others would be ideal, but isn’t always possible. That said, the beauty of free speech is that everyone gets to be heard.
When freedom of speech is restricted, people will be afraid of speaking out about evil practices in society. In the name of blocking harmful information, censorship will only end up restricting real information that truly empowers people. 
The lack of access to truths often leads to ignorance. That is something that nobody should ever advocate for.

7/8/22, 4:10 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: I certainly do. His opinions weren’t popular with the side that happened to dominate the twitterverse and they used that power to silence him. People must always be given the opportunity to hear both sides of an argument, so that they can make truly informed decisions.
7/8/22, 4:10 PM - +234 703 714 8734: ✔️

7/8/22, 4:24 PM - +234 817 271 4735: OBASANJO IS A HERO OF THE REVOLUTION..

When the story is told, it will begin with Former President Obasanjo asking Doyin Okupe to meet with Peter Obi and work out modalities for Obi's presidential campaign.

A shocked Okupe who himself had once contested for President however agreed and met with Obi. According to Okupe himself, the day he met with Peter Obi , and Obi booked economy flight tickets for both of them was the day he threw his hat into the ring and began to market Peter Obi to Nigerians with his whole heart and might. And we are seeing the results.

Obasanjo advised PDP governors to back Peter Obi as their candidate and they failed to do so. Obasanjo then arranged the move to Labour Party. 

Obasanjo proceeded to market Peter Obi to northern power brokers successfully. 

Obasanjo arranged for Peter Obi's invitation by the British PM and other meetings with the EU and other international interests.

Obadanjo, an elder in his 80s has been doing all this silently in the background, ever the patriot. While some young Nigerians are using their energies to campaign for old sick thieving politicians to continue to drag the nation backwards. 

Please a round of applause for Aremu Olusegun Obasanjo. 

His labour shall not be in vain.
7/8/22, 4:24 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Hmmm. The pendulum always swings the other way. As much as I do not like Reno, I still will not advocate for silencing him in this manner. This is just another form of cancel culture.
7/8/22, 4:25 PM - +234 806 566 2895: True but the man is trying to incite violence

That can take a life, and for what? How much money?
7/8/22, 4:30 PM - +234 817 950 7218: You should read up on Rwanda

No matter how much we like freedom of speech

There should be a limit to everything

Reckless speech has led to the loss of too many lives

There is no country in the world that doesn't regulate speech to a degree

There aren't all foolish
7/8/22, 4:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: People have tasted the effect of reckless speech and have learned from it
7/8/22, 4:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: That's why Facebook and Twitter have repeatedly blocked people and deleted posts over the years
7/8/22, 4:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree that cancel culture is wrong but we aren't disagreed on what Reno's intention was with that tweet

We are only talking because the north hasn't started burning houses, churches and killing people because of that tweet

If that happened, no one would be discussing if a ban is necessary or not

Hindsight is 2020 I guess but we can't be shortsighted all because the desired outcome of the poster hasn't been achieved
7/8/22, 4:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The only reason we are still debating freedom of speech is because the outcome we know is possible based on that tweet hasn't occurred

Once it does, everyone will be on the same side of the argument

But I don't believe in being reactive, we need to be proactive

He needs to be cautioned, no permanently but enough to know that such statements shouldn't be made
7/8/22, 4:35 PM - +234 817 034 1232: True 

We must not wait for Reno's desired outcome because we are supporting free speech.

Yes it has capacity to swing both ways

But reno wants live to he wasted because of power
7/8/22, 4:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I visited the genocide center and I tell you it is pathetic
7/8/22, 4:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The skulls are still there
7/8/22, 4:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: What Reno is doing can be taken for granted
7/8/22, 4:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But it is likely to lead to ethnic cleansing
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: All just to show support for Atiku
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: That's way too far
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The guy is evil minded


For someone who cannot speak hausa

But is now making his posts in hausa Language 

That should tell you his intentions 

As I cannot speak Yoruba I no go on to start making Yoruba posts back to back during election....what is my intention, if not to incite violence


The guy is a crook
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - +234 703 714 8734: You should also know this attempt to ban him is to protect the nation from the worst of him that may come out in the days ahead as will approach elections. 
We are all praying for peaceful elections in nigeria, prayer chains are on as we speak, you know that in nigeria, peaceful elections is a prayer point. This is why signing a petition against reno's divisive tweets is a faithful thing to do. We live here, and the peace of this country is our peace
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: I have, and I guess you have a point. That said, I hope that all the merits of this particular situation are taken into consideration before any actions with far reaching consequences are taken.
I’m not just given to the flippant way decisions are taken especially when it comes to issues on social media. Most times people are moved by emotions rather than intellect.
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly
7/8/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He even had to write in Hausa
7/8/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Now that's intentional
7/8/22, 4:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And purposeful
7/8/22, 4:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

If he posted in English and left it there I would ignore it

But also translating to Hausa? C'mon that's too far

I signed that petition with 100% conviction.

That man is evil
7/8/22, 4:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

He was aiming at violence, plain and simple

He is a very dangerous man using divisive strategies to propel a so called "unifier"
7/8/22, 4:42 PM - +234 817 034 1232: If it were you sef I would understand 

At least you lived in the North and can understand the language 

Dude has zero knowledge 

He had to use Google translate 

Pure evil
7/8/22, 4:42 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
7/8/22, 4:44 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Time to consult the gods on Reno's matter
7/8/22, 4:44 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He needed to communicate to the easily provoke average Hausa man who will propagate and spread his bitterness

7/8/22, 4:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And that PO called their leaders Kwankwanso driver
7/8/22, 4:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: PO i guess was using an analogy to describe things
7/8/22, 4:48 PM - +234 817 034 1232: As if Kwankwaso is a contender 

He knows he can't market Atiku
7/8/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He knows Atiku will remember him and PO doesn't have a job for him
7/8/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It is hard to live in UK and be flamboyant
7/8/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He needs to come.back home to make illegal money

His freedom to express himself ends where our freedom and right to a peaceful society begins. 

The guy has been bought by Atiku to be his spokesperson on social media.

Why is an outright ban and a rescinding of his business insider position necessary in this case?
Reno certainly has a forked tongue, but there are other ways to tame a snake apart from cutting of its tongue.
7/8/22, 11:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That's where you're wrong Abiola

Reno is in complete understanding of what he's doing. Complete. That's what makes him dangerous
7/8/22, 11:24 PM - +234 806 566 2895: They've been doing that but Elon Musk isn't Jack
7/8/22, 11:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He thinks he understands, but he doesn't doesn't Roland. Retrospectively, he will realize what a nuisance to our public space he has become. 

Let him be!. He who the gods ...., they first make...
7/8/22, 11:36 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: The very reason Elon Musk took over twitter was to ensure that freedom speech is protected. He is particularly not given to mob-rule/ cancel-culture.
Except Reno’s comments are proven beyond a shadow of doubt to be inciting, and except banning him is shown to be the most reasonable course of redress to Reno’s excesses; I’m afraid we will not be seeing a “Reno ban” anytime soon.
Anyway, it is what it is.
7/8/22, 11:37 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Abiola maybe you have been following Reno's tweets.

He understands completely. People think as they are. You for example cannot believe anyone who's educated can willing incite violence. It's unfathomable to you. But there are people who can and would not bat an eyelid as long as it serves their purpose.

He has been paid heavily and promised reentry into Nigeria society and you think he wouldn't sell his mother? You don't know Reno

The man is a soulless goon, gun for hire, just like FFK. No he's worse than FFK
7/8/22, 11:37 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It was always a long shot but the number of votes will tell even Reno to thread carefully
7/8/22, 11:39 PM - +234 806 537 0692: The number and the speed of growth ..
7/8/22, 11:39 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly
7/8/22, 11:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He can't fight a movement or ideology. It swallows you at the end. Thus the premise that he thinks speaking I'll of a man with a good heart, improves the chances of his principal, but forgets you don't get away with such.

Don't be surprised he would be another casaulty of PO antagonist.

He is obviously loosing it and any shred of relevence left
7/8/22, 11:50 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I doubt he is losing much

Truth be told, he has been the only somewhat successful anti-PO influencer. Most have given up. His need for success is what is making him push boundaries of civility

For whatever reason, tomorrow evil men will recognize his quality and still use him

Whenever people thinks he's evil, he just has to sprinkle a little bit of religion here and there and past sins are forgotten
7/8/22, 11:51 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Oh, I’m certain Reno has gotten the message.
7/8/22, 11:55 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I really doubt it and I would say time would tell but I await his next tweet

7/9/22, 7:52 AM - +234 806 529 3872: *BREAKING NEWS!!!!*

*A new pandemic has been reported in Nigeria that is spreading across Nigeria and faster than COVID-19.*

*The earliest variant was first discovered in Onitsha in Anambra State in 2010, but it later disappeared sometime in February 2018.*

*Virologists and scientists across Nigeria have now named the virus OBID-23, due to it fast rate of spread. Although thousands of elderly persons are already down with this virus, experts say YOUTHS are more predisposed to contracting this OBID-23 virus.*

*The fatality rate of this new virus is ZERO and the symptoms include.*

*(1.) Unusual desire for good governance*.

*(2.) Severe hunger and thirst for Economically advanced, safer and better Nigeria*.

*(3.) Complete loss of appetite for giving or accepting 'Shi-shi' (Bribe) and vote selling*

*(4.)  'Stinginess' and zero tolerance to economic wastages*

*(5.) High intolerance of tribalism, ethnicity, selfishness and religious discriminations.*

*(6.) Extraordinary compulsion to go to INEC CVR Center to register and get your PVC.*

*If you are showing any of these symptoms, then you may have contracted this virus. If you are already infected by the virus, please don't panic. Recent research at Ahmadu Bello University Center for virological studies has proved that victims of OBID-23 virus will remain absolutely healthy and ready to champion the emergence of a new Nigeria.*

*Since the re-emergence of OBID-23 this year, World Health Organisation has remained perplexed and world leaders are keenly observing the development in Nigeria to determine if border closure will be necessary to contain the spread.*

*There is no known cure or preventive measures to protect people from OBID-23 virus. Once anyone comes in contact with the virus, it stays with the person for life and such OBID-23 victims are now called the OBI-DIENTS.*

*If you suspect that you might have contracted the OBID-23 infection, please quickly join the amazing group of People living with OBID-23 virus, which includes Peter Obi Support Network group or Take Back Naija Movement.*

*Share this post now to get someone infected by this great virus that is sweeping across Nigeria.*

The game is to make Peter Obi to look as if he is someone that doesn't accept criticism. They want to achieve that by labeling Peter Obi's supporters as tyrant, religious big0t and undemocratic. They will keep hitting up the polity till they will get what they want.

In order for them not to achieve this, Peter Obi's supporters should stop commenting on their posts. It's simple.

Like Obama focus on the issues and wins your critics over by love.

The oil over PO head, is enough. He doesn't need to reply his haters.

Let Reno throw dabs, it will only make Obi popular. We have serious issues than channel our energies to 'paid critics'.

They will be more Reno's as we head to the elections, and we must realize that silence sometimes is what keeps us going.

I wish Obidients tow the approach taken by PO, but can you beat a child, and tell the child not to cry?
Some obidients are irritatingly arrogant, but can you blame them?. These guys are at the receiving end?.


Distraction is a game in politics, employed by the opposition to water down the growing acceptance of the Obi movement.

Obi doesn't need to reply Reno. He has a superior emotional intelligence. Let him focus on getting the message to the north,  logistics for elections vis a vis agents, crowd funding, etc.

Onuh may be right, it may not be about Reno tomorrow, but snuffing out his oxygen to express his views may set a bad precedent.

Let the young Man be, not because he doesn't deserve to be 'stoned' for breeching an already fragile security situation, but because, you cannot exorcise the freedom to speak within the limits tolerable by the beginning of the freedom of others

7/10/22, 9:39 AM - +234 703 714 8734: TINUBU'S SOCIAL MEDIA ARMY READY NOW TO SWOOP ON PETER OBI
Basil Okoh

The Bola Ahmed Tinubu Social Media Team has just completed training at Nicon Transcorp Hotel Abuja, to resume work on the 2023 presidential campaign. Another team has also completed its training in Lagos. Well provisioned offices have been made ready for them in Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt as was done for them in 2015. 

In 2014/15, APC had to travel to the US to procure Rahm Emmanuel, a Jew and Barak Obama's pointman to design a campaign for Muhammadu Buhari. We don't know yet where these trainers come from.

I am informed that their major assignment is to roll back the Peter Obi political momentum that appears to be taking over Nigeria. 

They are well trained by professional hackers and experienced trolling practitioners.
But truly Bola Tinubu's challenges in this election is not from Peter Obi but from himself and his own political party. 

He has to find a way to dispel rumours of his own terminal illness. For nearly a fortnight now, he has been lying critically sick in a French hospital after spending over four months in a British hospital and returning just in time to contest the APC presidential primaries, where it is claimed he spent well over a hundred and fifty million dollars on delegates, contestants and governor's alike to win the primaries.

The unending cause of laughter in the public arena in Nigeria today are the many videos and pictures of him wetting his clothes with his own urine in the public, falling over tables everywhere he goes and being unable to hold up the APC flag handed to him by Muhammadu Buhari. His geriatric challenges worry his handlers and the voting public to no end.

Outside his own health challenge is the unending hollowing out of the APC in Northern Nigeria. The entire northern bloc of the APC are defecting into PDP to identify and vote for their kinsman Atiku Abubakar. Not more than a forthnight ago, the entire Northern Senate caucus of the APC was to defect into the PDP but wiser counsel prevailed on them to tarry awhile in order not to give PDP a majority to harass the Buhari government. 

It should be obvious now to Bola Tinubu that he does not have the men for a ground campaign operation in Northern Nigeria. How then does he hope to win in the north?

So Bola Tinubu's election challenge is not Peter Obi but from himself and his party. No one can tell now if he has settled the issues of his identity fraud and the issues arising from his alleged academic qualification and eligibility for the office of president. It is a public shame that a supposed professional from Yorubaland should have his academic fitness for office questioned.

So no matter how many people Bola Tinubu trains for Social Media rampage on Peter Obi, it will not help his own electoral chances unless and until he overcomes his health, certificate and political party challenges. In order words, the fall of Peter Obi will not help or improve the chances of Bola Tinubu. 
His efforts and expenditures on training of hackers and Social Media disrupters to pummel and browbeat Peter Obi cannot help or improve Bola Tinubu's electoral chances until he overcomes his own personal difficulties.

Moreover, like other establishment politicians in Nigeria, Bola Tinubu and his team are misreading the Peter Obi phenomenon. They obviously do not understand what is happening right before their eyes. Entrenched in the ways of the political past, they cannot understand the political phenomenon driving the Peter Obi political whirlwind which has been building and taken decades to arrive. 

They have labeled it with ethnic slurs but it didn't stick. Governor Obaseki acknowledged that. So without a guiding map, Bola Tinubu and the establishment politicians want to deal with the Peter Obi tsunami in the ways of the past, with the tools they know and the tried strategies and tactics that they had mastered and has worked for them in the past. The strategies they have used in the past like tribalism, radicalism, violence or even media harassment or branding in any form will not work with the Peter Obi movement. 

The traditional media impact in this campaign and election will be minimal. There's hardly any newspaper in Nigeria today with a circulation of 300,000 in a population of 200 million people. Sunday Times circulated a million copies in the eighties under the editorship of Ray Ekpu. So the impact of traditional newspapers are waning in Nigeria.

Bola Tinubu and his social media team dominated the online media in the 2015 presidential campaigns. They were able to run rings around the Goodluck Jonathan and PDP campaigns and give them a bloody nose because the PDP men including Dr. Reuben Abati were fighting over money and couldn't really come to terms with the fight on their hands.

Peter Obi is a different kind of opponent because first he has no team and yet the man has garnered ten million soldiers in the social media war. And the big battalion will eventually win as always in every war. Peter Obi's army will fight an asymmetric warfare because it has neither form nor shape or even a central command. They will scorch and overwhelm Tinubu and everybody else's army.

What the Bola Tinubu Media Team has been instructed to do is to bombard Peter Obi's credibility and tear it down completely to shreds in the next couple of months. This can only have a marginal effect because the overwhelming majority of the man's followers have been bought and sold on Peter Obi. Millions of them work, sleep and wake in the online media and understand the game better than even the trainers at Transcorp. 

Moreover the media trainers forget that this is a generational fight, not the tribal war they always make Nigerian elections to become and that their youth audience are a deeply wronged and angry generation who have not forgotten the role of Bola Tinubu in shedding the blood of innocent youth at Lekki Tollgate on October 20 2020. Tinubu they believe, has the blood of Nigerian youth in his hands and they are determined to make him pay.

7/11/22, 12:02 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But then they wrote on the underlying document that autopsy done in 2020
7/11/22, 12:02 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Except it is for another person
7/11/22, 12:02 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Then wahala dey

7/14/22, 7:28 AM - +234 806 566 2895: But how can someone be so insensitive?

You must have a personal experience before you can understand someone else's pain?

That's too sad
7/14/22, 7:28 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Why is he wailing

May Nigeria keep happening to him
7/14/22, 7:29 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I dey pity am but mehn see comments 😓
7/14/22, 7:29 AM - +234 817 034 1232: So if this did not happen to him he will not have sense
7/14/22, 7:29 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

That seems to be the solution
7/14/22, 7:29 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Zero pity for him
7/14/22, 7:29 AM - +234 817 034 1232: By dem everybody go d9n die na
7/14/22, 7:32 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes na 

You can't support criminals in 2023 and when something happens to you as a result of their policies....you expect pity

If Buhari comes for 3rd term against Peter at this juncture I fit support am....make the supporters get sense from hardship 

Just that e fit reach you🤣
7/14/22, 7:36 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's just one dimensional thinking that worries BATIKU supporters

An APC supporter on a twitter space said something that really struck me and others as smart

He said that he's been working with Lagos government and with Tinubu for 12years. He said if Tinubu wins, he'll be appointed a special aide at the very least

The guy said but he's supporting Peter Obi simply because there's no appointment they'll give him that him that will provide enough money to meet the needs of all those that call him everyday to beg.

He said he was tired of never ending begging "bros abeg send me money". He said it's better the country works so that everyone will be ok and can fend for themselves.

Special aide cannot feed 100 hungry families. That if APC sanctions him for anti-party activities, so be it

Omo! Na so everyone dey hail am for what should be simple logic that fails others
7/14/22, 7:38 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Fair enough 😅

I wish no one evil, even though I believe it's only fair that those who voted this wicked government reap the benefits. 

Also, experience seems a more potent teacher
7/14/22, 7:40 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Better Atiku sef

How will you see Tinubu and consider him

Someone said that on the last day with hell fire staring at those who supported Buhari and subsequently Tinubu - they will naturally stand with Satan against God if given the opportunity to repent on the last day🤣
7/14/22, 7:40 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Must one experience to get sense
7/14/22, 7:41 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

At least Atiku and Kwankwaso picked a Christian demonstrating they are Muslim enough 

Peter obi picked a Muslim demonstrating he is Christian enough


What do you say about a dangerous character like Tinubu who feels he is not Muslim enough and Lalong who is a Christian is not Northern enough....thereby picking a terrorist as his VP
7/14/22, 11:48 AM - +234 806 566 2895: As them bash am for social media sey him be bigot na him e go find Cherubim and Seraphim😜 with staff to part the red seas?

7/14/22, 11:57 AM - +234 817 034 1232: That's better na

Imaging Atiku sweeping Kano votes....that will dampen his momentum during the count.

But if Kwankwaso/Tinubu takes a chunk from it....then it's better 

Because outside southwest Tinubu is going nowhere.

It's a 2 way contest Atiku vs Peter
7/14/22, 11:57 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *dampen Peter's momentum

Shey he was saying his preferred candidate will be from South East.

Abi he doesn't know where South East is again

It's just a pity that he wasn't wise enough to be Peter's deputy

That would have set him up politically quite well

7/15/22, 6:38 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I heard good things about Kwankwanso previously

I would have expected him to have agreed to be Obi's VP considering the fact that the North has just finished ruling for 8years

I also expected him to be aware enough to know that he doesn't have enough independent support to win and to understand that Peter Obis supporters wouldn't vote him if he were Kwankwanso's VP.

And then to now pick this Idahosa as running mate

His interview at channels also didn't go so well

I've heard great things about him but I have honestly been disappointed with his decision making recently and it makes me question all I've heard about him
7/15/22, 6:52 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The guy is just greedy

To get good leaders, educate the people.

Or kill ASUU, and reduce the number of educated folks

What a joke
7/15/22, 7:46 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let’s assume he had poor quality data and that influenced his poor decision making. OR he didn’t even use data available at all and relied on sentiments in an age of the 4th industrial revolution
7/15/22, 7:48 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: A lesson the US learnt long ago and adopted the electoral votes process tho still flawed in a number of ways.

7/17/22, 6:33 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The bvas system is good to an extent na

At least you can't stuff ballot box again
7/17/22, 6:34 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Wouldn't be that massive without protest
7/17/22, 6:34 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Okay, this makes sense
7/17/22, 6:35 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Some of the registered voters are dead, some haven't picked up their PVCs, some don't live there anymore, some have just their views card

On average, it's around 40-60% I think.
7/17/22, 6:35 AM - +234 817 950 7218: *some have lost their voters card
7/17/22, 6:35 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Wow this is a big issue oh
7/17/22, 6:36 AM - +234 806 965 1788: And still some may not come out to vote.
7/17/22, 6:36 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's the usual thing. All results I remember seeing don't have upto 50 % of registered voters turning up to vote
7/17/22, 6:36 AM - +234 806 965 1788: Among those with PVC
7/17/22, 6:36 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yes. A lot will simply not come out
7/17/22, 6:36 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Then is INEC has this data why still not doing anything. About some are dead (this I don't think may be that highly significant) to account for over 60%
7/17/22, 6:37 AM - +234 803 097 7516: This is a strong one which we may need to start addressing
7/17/22, 6:37 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And I believe it is the largest chunk of all the other reasons
7/17/22, 6:38 AM - +234 803 097 7516: None only one. And that has very small total registered
7/17/22, 6:38 AM - +234 803 097 7516: One thing is sure. The message is passed to the ruling party.
7/17/22, 6:39 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Osun has shown that no one own a people.
7/17/22, 6:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Gbam
7/17/22, 6:40 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Since osun and oyo is in the hands of PDP with lagos being cosmopolitan 

Tinubu is finished 

Let INEC declare the result and confirm our prophecy
7/17/22, 6:41 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Like Otoge in Kwara, Imole dee has shown that the Yoruba people are unpredictable
7/17/22, 6:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Tinubu can not rely on them
7/17/22, 6:42 AM - +234 803 097 7516: He needs to know that now
7/17/22, 6:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes 

They are the least biased electorate
7/17/22, 6:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Then north central

The former interim National Chairman of APC, Chief Bisi Akande is from Osun state.
The current National Secretary of APC, Send Iyola Omishore is from Osun state.
Bola Tinubu is from Osun state. 
Femi Fani Kayode is from Osun State.
Femi Adesina is from Osun state
The Deputy National Chairman of APC is from Osun state.
The current Governor of Osun state is Tinubu's Cousin.

These are the structures APC have in Osun state and they still lost the election. If this is not a strong pointer, then they should expect more wahala in 2023. Indeed peoples voice and vote do count.....

#ObiDatti2023
7/17/22, 3:51 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Smiles. Obi was the first in recent past to get his mandate from the courts. Not just once, he got his second mandate when he was wrongfully  impeached by the house.

This was a time God father's ruled Anambra and Anambra was the worst state to govern, by security reports at the time.

😊😊 It has happened before in Nigeria. 

The question should rather be, would it happen again?

Will the Judiciary be again the one to determine Nigeria's next President?


Only time will tell, until then focus on deliverables in a language every Nigerian understands, and showing love in place of Hate and criticism is the way to go for All Obidients.

Nigeria may not be sane, but Anambra was a microsm of the current conundrum at the time, and it happened twice.

I think the cards are on Obi's laps now!

God forbid *BAT* things and the *ARTIKULATIONS* of evil men for Nigeria. May the *OBICENTRIC* tendencies and aspirations find a focal point in All Nigerians

Happy Birthday to Peter Obi, my dearest Big Bro:
 
I will never forget your kindness to my beloved parents. Thank you for the respect you showed them, for your many visits to Abba, where you gave to Daddy and Mummy the most precious gifts: your time and your attention.
 
Thank you for walking this still-unbearable journey of grief with my siblings and me.
 
I remember how you regaled Daddy and Mummy with your stories until we started joking about your obsession with the “GDP of Malaysia.” But your obsession spoke of hope: your hope for Nigeria, your belief in what Nigeria could be. A belief that has always been practical, grounded in numbers and in reality.
 
I remember when you came to support me as I was being honored by the United Nations Foundation in New York, and I teased you about the inexpensive hotel you were staying in, and you shrugged and said, “it’s just a place to sleep, why do I need to be in an expensive place?”

And then only days later, you once again exhibited your incredible generosity to the causes you believe in, and it reminded me of all the hospitals and schools and churches you have supported over the years, and often without fanfare. You have always been clear about what your priorities are, what matters to you, what you believe should matter, and that is deeply admirable.
 
I have always admired your humane pragmatism, how you are willing to talk to almost anyone if it will bring about a good outcome.
And how you believe in certain ideals without being an ideologue.
And how you see people as people, knowing that human value is not measured in material terms.
And how you are able to laugh at yourself, and laugh when I tease you about your ‘one shoe and one shirt.’
And how you have always been consistent in the core of who you are. 
 
Thank you for your compassion and your circumspection. For your honesty and your humour. For your willingness to acknowledge flaws, yours and others’, knowing that nobody is perfect. For your fuss-free kindness and your humility that is never performative.
 
I am inspired by your intellectual curiosity, your eagerness to learn, your genuine love of education (which is why you sought out, and honored, Daddy all those years ago when you learned that he was Nigeria’s first professor of statistics.)
 
Sometimes it is the simplest of language that captures the most complex of things, and so I will end with simplicity: You are a good man. You are loved. You are appreciated.
 
May your eyes continue to light up when you talk about the lovely confident Margaret (Thank God she agreed for you!) and your lovely children, A and E. 
 
May joy follow you and yours always.
 
Mummy called you her ‘first son,’ my siblings and I call you our 'big bro,' and I cannot wait to call you ‘My President.’ 
 
I cannot wait for February 25, 2023, when I, with personal pride in you and with hope for what Nigeria can become, will cast my vote for you and your running mate, Senator Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed. 
 
Chukwu dube gi. God Keep you. 
 
With love, Chimamanda.

Any thumb print crossing outside the box would be invalid. The emphasis on the name Peter Obi should switch to the Logo with 'Papa, Mama and Pikin', ' Baba, Iyawo ati Omo', ' Baba, Mama, Yaro etc. With the Red and Green background.


On d day, Peter/Datti won't be on the ballot but the logo of the family which would be the fulcrum of the new renaissance in Nigeria.

7/20/22, 9:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Another point for conversation is the materials the ballot papers are made from. In the off season elections you had double voting on  ballot papers that became invalid just because the finger print got imbibed when the ballot papers where folded. The gap in the Osun elections was less than 30 k and over 10 k votes were invalid.

If elections will be close, invalid votes could be costly as it could sway the result on either side when done wrongly.

The buildup to the campaigns that starts in September must educate voters on how to properly thumb print minimizing the invalid votes.

Slowly but surely. With no apologies to BAT and Atiku's adherents here, Obi and Datti make the team that will bring us out of the woods and they will have every spiritual, financial etc back up they need.

The country is sliding down and on the edge of becoming extinct if no drastic measures are taken

7/20/22, 9:51 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You're quite right Abiola

The printing of ballot papers with faces can make the process more expensive at face value. But any country that values the integrity and upholds it, knows that it's important people know who exactly they're voting.

The politicians don't mind the crudeness of the current process because they're often direct beneficiaries

But we must start to demand change in apparently small areas like this
7/20/22, 9:59 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Couldn't be better posited Rowland.

Change like you said in small areas add up eventually to the dreams we all yearn.

7/21/22, 5:59 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly my thoughts. It's not even that he tried to organize fake bishops. 

It's the inefficiency of the whole affair that gets to me

You weren't able to send people smart enough to coordinate activities better

Such a haphazard job for someone who is trying to run a country
7/21/22, 6:03 AM - +234 817 950 7218: In fairness to them

1. Putting people's face requires a lot more fine print quality and a lot more expensive to do

2. Seeing the face of the person doesn't make you know him. It only makes you know if he's handsome or not

The thing I find interesting is that on average, most Nigerians over 18 aren't total idiots

I think with sensitization they can identify party logos

7/21/22, 6:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Chino they exploit the logo thing a lot

For years people were told in the village, vote umbrella, broom. Can you imagine not knowing what the person you're voting looks like?
Just thumb printing for parties. Most illiterate persons can know their candidate's face from campaign

The gain from proper voting in my opinion trumps the extra cost
7/21/22, 7:03 AM - +234 817 950 7218: We too dey underrate Nigerian adults

But they will not do it now based on extra cost

Tinubu’s People Promised Me N100,000 But Paid Only N40,000: Angry Fake Catholic Bishop Cries Out

Journalist101July 20, 2022

Some hungry looking clergies at Muslim-Muslim Ticket event
One of the fake bishops apparently hired by Bola Tinubu’s campaign for the public presentation of Kashim Shettima as the vice presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has narrated how he was paid for the appearance.

The imposter, who identified himself as Joseph Odaudu according to Peoples Gazette, said Mr Tinubu’s hirelings broke a mutual agreement to be paid N100,000 for the shady job.

“They came to meet us at the car park behind Eagle Square and they promised to give me N100,000. They bought food for us and took us to another place where they gave us clothes to dress like Christian leaders and reverend fathers,” Mr Odaudu told The Gazette shortly after the event in Abuja on Wednesday. “But after we finished they only gave me N40,000 and another person said they got only N30,000. I don’t know why they changed our agreement because they said they had N100,000 for us.

“I am a Christian and I am supporting Tinubu but I hate when people lie and fail to deliver on their promises,” he added.

The fake bishops had appeared in a cassock to give Christian voters a false impression that Mr Tinubu’s decision to pick a Muslim northerner as his running-mate for the 2023 general election meant well for the country despite strong criticism from the Christian community and opinion leaders in the country.

The Catholic Church had described those who appeared at the event held at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja as “impostors,” telling The Gazette the church had no representation at the event.

When asked if he knew that it was illegal to disguise as a Catholic bishop, Mr Odaudu insisted he didn’t break any laws.

“No law was broken we only tried to show Nigerians that Christians are solidly behind Asiwaju Tinubu,” he added.

The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) had kicked against the choice of a Muslim-Muslim ticket and registered its opposition against the ruling decision of the ruling All Progressives Congress for the 2023 election.

Also, Christian leaders in the APC had repeatedly warned that the same religion ticket would spell doom for the party, following reactions and heavy criticism from Nigerians.

ESP those in the manufacturing business or retail biz. Essentially they adjust their prices in reaction to whatever inflation poor governance creates and still go home smiling. It is the consumers who suffer. This doesn’t mean they don’t get bitten too cos they also buy products they don’t produce. But they also benefit in a way. This is not to away from your point that they should actively get involved. 

Add to that the debacle of the Sit at home days resulting in a need to maximize the remaining 4 days in business.

7/23/22, 9:32 AM - +234 806 566 2895: See eh

That really isn't the reason. It's not that deep.

Let me say a little on what I think are the reasons for low voter registration in South east

1. Southeasterners have always felt like they're an appendage or a fringe part of the country, so they're were really not interested in national politics as the other tribes rarely grant them a seat at the table

2. They have always believed that elections are rigged, so they think "what's the point of stressing myself when you'll do what you do?"

3. Of all major tribes in Nigeria, Igbos are the most resilient due to their economic might. 

Generally, I would say they're the richest tribe. They may not have the richest men in Nigeria come from their region but they're generally wealthier than most tribes. 

This has been in spite of bad governance and discrimination. Igbos have learnt to withstand economic pressure. This is why things are the way they are in the east. If you like increase fuel price, they would mildly complain but go buy and increase cost of goods in the market to cope. Igbos believe "na poor man dey complain, make money so you can afford anything." I tell you, there are many spare part dealers and shop owners that would feed us doctors. In the West or North, that fuel station that raise fuel prices might be closed due to protest, I saw it happen in Osogbo in 2012...I was impressed.

The other major tribes are very invested in governance because their prosperity heavily relies on good governance. Hence the large voter turnout which also includes large swathes of Igbos living there I must add

4. There's deliberate voter disenfranchisement

7/23/22, 10:41 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Right and this is where the political will of the SE governor's and the buisness men taking out time to register and partake in this process.

If the naira is devalued or you find it hard to get Forex, how do you import? Or send your children to school?

How do the ports work to ease their buisnesses, if the roads are bad, it affects their business. 

If bad leadership is instilled and workers are not paid, how do their businesses thrive?

Many businesses have since closed.

The political will to be unselfish and support PO, and engage the agitators to allow people come out to register is key.

The south east must sit up and up their game.

I'm not convinced All the governor's are in support of PO. Everybody cannot be president per time.
7/23/22, 10:53 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Economic empowerment must always yield political will. This is where the east is missing it. Your wealth must translate to political power. What benefit is individual wealth when you can't wield political power to get better roads, schools, hospitals in the south East?

Individual buisnesses will  yield a million times profit, it the environment is conducive. If the ports are working and you can clear your goods in less than 24 hrs, if rail brings your goods home, without you physically been there. If the roads are good to transport your goods across the states. If power etc is there to keep the factories working and an IT backbone to improve on services.There is no doubt, if the environment is right there is no Nigerian who cannot overcome the world, be you from the East, West South or North
7/23/22, 11:21 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Abiola I agree that a conducive environment betters your chances but up till people felt helpless, particularly in the southeast.

Mr Presidential candidate: Lincoln did not contest US Presidency five or six times, Takeaways from Atiku Abubakar bungled interview on ARISE Television

We have watched Alhaji Atiku Abubakar’s interview on ARISE Television and were extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the Peoples Democratic Party's presidential candidate. 

In the interview, Alhaji Atiku exposed himself as a man who is not prepared for the job he is applying for and a man who can not be entrusted with our commonwealth. He was flippant in his response to important questions about his record of service and how he made money while serving in Customs. He muddled up facts and exhibited befudling absence of mind. 

Here are our takeaways from the bungled interview: 

1. PDP candidate is a law breaker: It was most shocking Atiku admitted that he cheated the system for decades and engaged in gross misconduct as a government worker. As a customs officer at the Idi-Iroko border, Atiku revealed that he ran a commercial taxi service, claiming ‘there is no law stopping public officers from doing business in Nigeria". He punched harder, claiming there is no conflict of interest in doing so. 

We found this to be untrue.

Every officer in the civil service is expected to comply with a code of conduct and service rules which bar civil and public servants from engaging in private business while in government employment to the detriment of the service he/she is employed to render to the public. The 1999 constitution further codifies this in Part I, Fifth Schedule, Section of 2 (b).

It says a public officer shall not, except where he is not employed on full-time basis engage or participate in the management or running of any private business, profession or trade. The rules however allow a public officer to engage in farming. 

We wonder which rule or which law Atiku was relying upon for his gross misconduct as a public officer.  It is our considered view that Atiku gamed the system all through his career in public service, culminating in his founding of the Intel Logistics along with Late Shehu Yar’Adua and some Italians, even while he was still in the employment of the Nigeria Customs Service.

2. Poor Knowledge of key sectors of the economy: We also found it surprising that the PDP presidential candidate does not know the contribution of oil and gas industry to Nigeria’s GDP. He claimed the sector represents 20% of our national GDP whereas it is below 10 percent and it is still falling owing to the growth of non-oil sector under the current All Progressives Congress led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. 

3. False Data from Egypt: Atiku Abubakar wanted to impress his audience with his supposed knowledge of international affairs. He ended up embarrassing himself with false data he cited from Egypt. We found his claim that Egypt has 2 million police officers on the streets to be untrue. Various sources put the number at about 500,000 for a population of 104 million and not 80 million as falsely claimed by Atiku.

4. Rotational Presidency: Asked to justify why the PDP jettisoned  Section 3c of its own constitution which enshrines power rotation between the North and South,  Atiku tried to fudge his answer by focussing on Governor Nyesom Wike and his effort to reconcile with him after he, a northerner snatched the presidential ticket that ought to have been taken by a southerner. While Atiku was playing to the gallery on APC's Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, he didn’t see seeking to be President after 8years of a President from his part of Nigeria as politics of exclusion.

Probed further, Atiku provided several contradictory answers. In one breath, he said power rotation is not in the constitution. In another breath, he said the PDP has never “micro zoned any position’. Then he admitted that the party has always rotated power between the North and the South. Atiku's justification as to why he became PDP's presidential candidate, instead of a southerner is a perfect example in ellipsis: “In politics”, he said, “we negotiate power through negotiations(Sic)”.  Whatever that means. 

Atiku ever an expert in not telling the truth also did not come clean over his once-upon a time preference for same-faith ticket. In 1993, after Atiku and Kingibe lost to MKO Abiola in the SDP presidential primary in Jos, Atiku was the choice of the Yar’Adua camp to become Abiola’s running mate. Abiola overlooked him and picked the more cerebral diplomat and bureaucrat, Babagana Kingibe. In all the tonnes of biographies written about him, there was no where he said he opposed Shehu Yar’Adua’s support for his candidacy as Abiola’s VP. He was not against it, since it favoured him. Now, it is politically convenient and opportunistic for him to oppose Tinubu-Shettima ticket.

5. Political Credentials: Most reprehensible was Atiku’s lies about how many times he ran to become the governor of Adamawa or old Gongola state.

Mr. Presidential candidate, in case you don’t know due to your limited education, you run for an office, only, when you are on the ballot in an election. Your signifying interest in an office does not mean the same as running for the office. From available records, the first time you contested the governorship election in your state was in 1999. Your name entered the ballot for the first time and you won. 

6. Poor grasp of history: Atiku Abubakar also exhibited poor Knowledge of history when he claimed that Abraham Lincoln, one of America’s famous leaders contested the presidency five to six times before he eventually won.

This is a beer parlour tale that has been recycled over time. Lincoln contested U.S. presidency twice. He ran in 1860 and 1864 and won both, before he was assassinated on 15 April, 1865.

The false story about Lincoln’s failed presidential bids sprang from his previous failed state and national elections, from his state of Illinois. They were not the same as America’s presidential election.

According to historians, Lincoln  lost his first election in 1832 for Illinois state legislature.  In 1834, he ran again and won. 

In 1843 he ran for Congress. He lost. Three years after in 1846, Lincoln ran for Congress again - this time he won  and went to Washington. From established history, in 1848, Lincoln ran for re-election to Congress and lost. In 1854, he ran for Senate of the United States. He  lost. Lincoln also made another failed bid for U.S. Senate from Illinois in 1858. He lost to Democrat Steven Douglas. 

Our conclusion is that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is ill-prepared to be President of Nigeria if he could bungle a Television interview that was planned well ahead of the day and time the duo of Dr. Reuben Abati and Ms.Tundun Abiola conducted it.

We expected the PDP presidential candidate to be well informed on any issue before coming on national television to expose himself to avoidable ridicule.

7/26/22, 5:54 AM - +234 806 529 3872: OBI on channels TV today.

SEUN: Mr, Peter obi.  Atiku said so many things about you, he said it will take a miracle for you to win the election, what's your take on that?

OBI: well, my Political journey has been a miracle.   So many things has happened in my life that people never thought would be possible. In 2003, i contested for the Anambra Governorship election under a party that was just one year old, people said it will take a miracle for me to win the election that year, I Won.

Six months later, i was impeached.  I challenged the impeachment in court, people said it will impossible for me to come back to Office, that  no governor has ever come back to office after impeachment, they said it will take a miracle for me to win the case in court, I won the case.

I came back to office and in 2007, an election was conducted and Andy Uba declared the winner.   I went to court again to seek for the interpretation of our laws, i told the court that the tenure of a Governor is Four years and i should be allowed to finish my tenue, people said it will take miracle for me to win that case, I won.

So my Political journey has been like a miracle and I'm waiting for the bigger miracle to happen in 2023.   That's my response to Atiku's statement.

SUEN:  Alright, Atiku said that 90% of northeners are not on social media, so he is not bothered about your popularity online.   What's your take on that?

OBI: Well, that's the problem I'm coming  to solve as the Nigerian President.  I have said it before that the north will be our new oil, i will convert that population to wealth through Production,. I will invest in education so that those who don't know how to operate the internet in the north, will learn how it is done. The north is our new oil.

SEUN:. Alright, maybe i should stop talking about what Atiku said and go into other topics but before i do that, i will like to ask you this question.  Atiku said you didn't inform him when you left the PDP, is that true?

OBI: Yes, it is true.

SEUN:. Why didn't you inform him? As his former running mate, many expected you to inform your former boss before taking that decision.

OBI:. You see Seun,. A time will come in a man's life, where he will decide to take a very Strong decision about his life and his people, without informing those who are likely to tell him not to take such decision.    I have so many important people in my life that i didn't tell that i was going to leave PDP, i didn't even tell my family at that time..   i took that decision because it is the best thing to do and i didn't want anybody to distract me.

Remember when i left, i told Nigerians that i rather lose doing the right thing, than win doing the wrong thing.

SEUN;. How will your security plan be like?

OBI: it will be immediate and desicive.
I will pull people out of poverty, it has been Proven that the more you pull people out of poverty, the more you reduce crime., I will invest in education and military manpower.   All options will be on the table.

Me: Now i understand why Peter Obi pleaded that his supporters should not reply any Presidential candidate that attacks him, he said his supporters should allow him do the job. This is it, he wants to embarrass them with love and intelligence.

7/27/22, 9:25 AM - +234 810 006 7926: The President should be impeached. He has been regularly irregular in securing our lives and livelihood. How can you be in Liberia at this time? And to do what? Give a speech on insecurity in Liberia when your own country is under siege of terrorist and islamic fundamentalists?

Very soon, this will move from realm of threat to reality.

If I were your principal who you voted for and have reposed so much confidence in, I will rather resign and save myself and my adherents and supporters the shame that might take us unawares.

It's unfortunate that Buhari and his voters or supporters where not prepared to govern and winning the 2015 came as a surprise.

How do you propose to spend 6 trillion naira on subsidy when 7 years ago our total budget was less than 5 trillion in a country that consumes less than 30 million barrels per day. When in the history of our country did we spend close to 80 of our budget for subsidy and servicing debts that have mortagaged the future of our children.
7/27/22, 10:12 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Half of the population is in poverty. 100 million Nigerians. How do you explain that? 

Are you grandstanding or trying to justify his stay or hope the rubber stamp senators won't turn their backs on him if their relatives are kidnapped and raped?
7/27/22, 10:13 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 👌🏻
7/27/22, 10:17 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Jokers

If their relatives had died in the ongoing insurgency would they be threatening?
7/27/22, 10:18 AM - +234 806 566 2895: He is saying that our lawmakers are soulless

They won't impeach
7/27/22, 10:19 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Okay
7/27/22, 10:22 AM - +234 810 006 7926: They will soon feel the heat and dance to a different tune soon.
7/27/22, 10:22 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I very much doubt that

Certainly not under this regime
7/27/22, 10:24 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Ango Abdullahi felt it and sang a different tune in this administration. An elders rates man.

Nothing is impossible
7/27/22, 10:24 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Okay
7/27/22, 10:25 AM - +234 810 006 7926: If the current trend is not mitigated, it will consume everyone. The security details of Mr President was ambushed a few days ago. They have threatened to kidnap the president himself
7/27/22, 10:27 AM - +234 806 092 4290: In a sane country, he will even voluntarily resign. Imagine a president declaring he is tired and can't wait to live office, coupled with the near collapse of the nation, and we still have lawmakers sitting there "representing the masses"
7/27/22, 10:30 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

I'm ashamed for his lack of shame. I desperately try each day to wall my heart from hating Buhari. Believe me when I tell you, it's a tough battle.

I ask myself, "how can someone be such a disaster, a failure?" 

There was never a president who deserved impeachment
7/27/22, 10:31 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Buhari failure looks like what happens when someone tries to fail
7/27/22, 10:34 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I think the aim is to make the govt at the center weak and a take over by terrorists to foister and administer a new dispensation.  A similar experience in Afghanistan I think.

I doubt Buhari's true intentions. It may be more than what meets the eye
7/27/22, 10:39 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's very possible
7/27/22, 10:39 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

It's hard to deny his complicity, at the very least conflict of interest
7/27/22, 10:40 AM - +234 810 006 7926: And once this is achieved, there will be no elections
7/27/22, 10:40 AM - +234 806 566 2895: True
7/27/22, 11:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Abiola you really have hope for this country🤣

Let me tell you one thing but you would not believe it.


Ambushing Buhari's security was planned with Buhari and the terrorists....the threat of kidnap was him telling the terrorists to televise it in a secret phone call with the terrorists 

So you can sympathise with him.

7/27/22, 3:04 PM - +234 810 006 7926: We can't even service our debts any longer. Oil is no longer the major earner. The debt burden is in trillions that would take generations to pay. Now you have to pay your debts, No more debt cancellation like Okonjo got for us during OBJ's presidency.

The naira may hit #1,000 naira to a dollar, if the downward slide continues.

The economic indices are alarming and only a frugal team in Obi/ Datti and the team, they will assemble can bring us out of the woods.

Atiku sold all govt parastatals to croonies and 99 percent are comatose. Nigeria is in dire straights to tinker or risk an Atiku or Tinubu.

The earlier we all understand the enormity of our decline and the urgent need to make a statement with our votes and that of our families the better.
7/27/22, 3:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Solid points raised. I strongly support the Obi/Datti team @2348100067926 . However, like I have tried to tell everyone else, I’d love to suggest that everyone rooting for them effectively manages their expectations. This is very key to helping them succeed. Whoever wins the elections will not find governance or Nigeria a walk in the park. The issues are numerous and daunting. It didn’t take 100 days to get into this mess. It won’t take 100 days to get out of it. I believe they will be shocked at the discoveries when they get in.
7/27/22, 3:12 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: A simple principle of logic says that if you do not expect too much, you won’t be dissapointed at a little. no doubt the body language of the president can signal a lot about the direction of governance. The losses will not be reversed suddenly.
7/27/22, 3:17 PM - +234 806 092 4290: You are completely right. Hence the need to get a pilot that can at least be able to control the plane that has already lost its radar from crashing, before gradually finding a way to recover it's way down
7/27/22, 3:17 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I believe it may take time but they will stop the leakages and mitigate the downward slide. 

Solutions to our problems are not rocket science, it's just visionary leadership and the OBIDATTI team will do it in 4 years.

I may not expect a miracle, but let this downward slide to a failed( if not failed already) state.

For a leader who knows his onions, it doesn't take time to demonstrate palpable changes.

I thought the subject of discussion was on impeachment of the president? Does Jonathan have power to impeach the president? My posts are about the senate that you expect them to impeach the president. They are all guilty of where we are presently, and not just Buhari, so for you to think they can wake up and do anything to their master, that is a day dream. Their hands are all soiled. These include our Governors down to the least political holder. Those that have refused to pay workers' wages, are they doing so because of Buhari? We are talking about current government which is not only about Buhari but all our political leaders

I bliv he is there for a religious agenda, and it may consume him and his adherents
7/27/22, 4:10 PM - +234 806 092 4290: You are wrong. I am talking about the senate that we are clamouring for them to impeach Buhari. We all want him impeached or resigned but we don't have a clean parliament that can be bold to do that because they are all responsible for the downfall and not just Buhari. So stop saying what I didn't say. Go and read previous comments

7/27/22, 4:16 PM - Paul Ashir: They may not do it but not because they are not clean. My thought is: our security operatives get intelligence reports and share daily but will lift no finger to change anything. The other thought is why?
7/27/22, 4:23 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I give up. I can see you have parliamentarians that are capable of impeaching Buhari, and we are still where we are. This is 7 years of progressive calamity. Are we just waking up to the reality on ground? What is happening now that is a surprise to you? If you had people in the parliament that are capable of impeaching the president and they have not done it before now? How many of the APC politicians, who are majority in the parliament come out to condemn the incompetence of the government? I wish you good luck in your advocacy to have the president impeached
7/27/22, 4:24 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Why? You don't know? Who controls the securities?
7/27/22, 4:25 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Are you sure with the gale of defections and impending defections APC will remain in the majority?..

The APC majority leader in the Senate just decamped recently and a new one inaugurated today
7/27/22, 4:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If his impeachment wasn't feasible, they wouldn't have gone on a recess suddenly.
7/27/22, 4:27 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Why?

Because Buhari is a terrorist 

And he is empowering his fellow terrorists to grab lands

They plotted to remove the speaker 2days ago so that they can pass their RUGA Law

While Buhari is trying to grab land through the law....his brother terrorists are doing so through brute force

A 2 pronged approach
7/27/22, 4:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Lawan is even afraid of been impeached and wants time to fight for his senatorial ticket
7/27/22, 4:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Recently you made a statement where you said you never regretted voting for Buhari on this platform and at the time I questioned your not taking responsibility for making a mistake for voting him.

And your statements seemed to assuage this understanding

Someone cannot be this detached from reality!

7/29/22, 9:46 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Her reality is not our reality. She gets dollars at 420naira from CBN or even for free and can sell it through her cronies at 710. The higher it goes,the more she can make.
She does not buy food,electricity, pay rent or fuel her vehicles from her personal funds..whats govt funds for? She doesn't even pay her children's school fees from personal funds.
She is in the most robust financial state she has ever been all her life.. so she is right. She has built a better economy (for herself and her family members)..than what they had in the previous administration. #facts
7/29/22, 9:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think you just captured my thoughts. It is actually possible for people to live in the same world and yet experience varying realities.
7/29/22, 9:53 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: A lot of these people in Govt do everything in style.  You are driven from home to the office in bullet proof cars, stewards everywhere doing your bidding, you don’t even shop for yourself esp the basic things. Even their jewelries, the jewelers bring direct to the house for them to select. And lots more examples. So yes they can be detached
7/29/22, 9:54 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: From actual reality. It’s possible to live in abuja for years and never have a need to pass thru Nyanya, Zuba or the other communities that may give a glimpse of reality. From Govt house straight to the airport and out of the city. As often as possible
7/29/22, 9:55 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let me also add… doctors come to consult at home too.
7/29/22, 9:57 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Detached and shielded by the "yes men" around them. Nobody in their cycle  can tell them anything different.
7/29/22, 9:59 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The impunity is to the high heavens. Let me share a recent experience. I was privileged to escort a good friend to NNPC to deliver a “Goodwill Message”. She was going to deliver $10,000 to a managing director to secure an appointment for a visit by the Executive director of their oil company as they were bidding to lift Liquefied Natural gas or so… a contract worth billions. When she gave him the parcel, Oga opened it and pulled out the bundle, opened another drawer littered with different currencies (new) just so we could see that what we came with was actually nothing and threw it in there
7/29/22, 10:01 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And then said his secretary would get back to her. She made me understand that the time frame of this get back could mean anything from 2 months to a year depending on your level of follow up.
7/29/22, 10:01 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you don’t follow up, your file will be tagged “Keep In View” while those who follow up will be treated .
7/29/22, 10:03 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: That’s one end of the chain. I was made to realize that at the other end if you indeed got the contract and delivered, for your payments to be approved and processed at the CBN end, you needed to send another CBN official another “Goodwill message” same amount or more for him to just call his staff and fast track your payment.
7/29/22, 10:04 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Now imagine the number of contracts awarded yearly and payments made so you see the huge amount of corruption going on. You now recall Datti Ahmed’s grouping Abi grading of corruption.
7/29/22, 10:05 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Then there is the story of the director woman at the ministry of Lands and … who I am told can just like you and bless you with land allocations
7/29/22, 10:05 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: At her own discretion. How do they do this
7/29/22, 10:06 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Remember that there is a lot of resettlement of original indigenes of the FCT who are disloged
7/29/22, 10:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Officially they are supposed to be resettled. Now this particular ministry generates a list of maybe 500 names of people to be given land amongst which is maybe 100 -150 of the original displaced families. The remaining 350 names would be names of chronies and government people owed favors. So you see a civil servant in a federal ministry with a salary of 150k but the doings enh

7/29/22, 11:15 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The arrangement was actually made for Nigerians working within the US and Canadian Embassies not able to go far to register. The Yellow badge is mostly worn by Embassy staff.
7/29/22, 11:22 AM - +234 806 537 0692: I get your point @2348032813842 and @14159348891 ...

She can be truly detached from the reality of normal Nigerians.

However, what happened to Objective assessment of the Economy of a Nation ... GDP, Inflation rate, National debt, Foreign Reserves, Naira devaluation among others ... These are indices used to assess the Economic status of a Nation.

Is a Finance Minister also supposed to be detached from these indices which have grossly worsened under this administration?
7/29/22, 11:33 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’ll paint a scenario to answer this. A lot of doctors would rather be doing something else….. I may be wrong. However, doctoring for now pays the bills. So they do the job, they may not be necessarily invested in it. All these indices you mentioned @2348065370692, they know it. Whether they understand the big picture is a different story entirely and assuming they do, whether they really care is a question that begs to be answered. There is also the place of vested interests.
7/29/22, 11:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: They understand the big picture and don't care
7/29/22, 11:47 AM - +234 803 281 3842: This is a government that repeatedly tries to deceive and misled. It should not come as a surprise nau
7/29/22, 11:49 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: This is what Nigeria has to contend with. If you are from the north and you still support this administration, then remember that the monster you’re feeding has began to consume your Keith and kin. It’s only a matter of time before it comes for you.

Parties may not be as important as personalities, but it's largely incontrovertible today that APC is a poisoned pathway. This isn't even subtle, but palpably stark. 

This is a party that has given Nigerians insecurity in its crudest and pervasive form. 
From the potentates to the proletariats no one is safe in almost all parts of the country. Human lives are daily hacked down by both known and unknown faces, and the APC government appears lost and helpless. The government seems to be at her wit's end over the increasingly ravaging insecurity the country is enduring. 

Corruption is arguably at all time high at the moment. Economy is tanking steadily and incrementally. Stagflation is at its most malignant viciousness. The middle class is rapidly disappearing, and the lower class' despondency is the densest in the country's beleaguered history today. Miscellaneous crimes are mushrooming in the inner cities and villages. And why not? People will have to eat, and the minimum wage cannot sustain an individual for a couple of weeks no matter the degree of austerity measures he/she deploys. Then imagine such a person having a family of 4 or 5. There's certainly no way such family can survive in today's Nigeria without resorting to crime. No way! 

The APC flag bearer has boasted countlessly how he was pivotal to the emergence of our current leadership. He foisted a leadership on us and did little or nothing as the government drifted rudderlessly as manifold and mounting hardship and savagery are visited on the people. The APC candidate should have nothing but spirited apologies to all Nigerians for orchestrating the horror they are witnessing today. But no, instead of recoiling in pensive regrets, he has come out right on the same platform that bequeathed bedlam to the people to continue with her lugubrious legacy. He even recklessly says it is his turn (EMILOKAN). What a condescending audacity!. What a disregard to the sensibilities and sensitivities of the bulk of Nigerian populace. 

Except majority of Nigerians are afflicted by a very severe form of Stockholm syndrome, they wouldn't let that happen. They shouldn't let that happen. February 2023 will be a time for insight assessment of the Nigerian electorates. I believe they won't show themselves as insightless. There's a saying in Igbo language that "uzo di mma, a ga ya nga nabo" (you only repeat or return through a path that was favourable the first time). It's time for Nigeria to try a different route, and I believe they will for repeating an action and expect a different result is one definition of lunacy...so said Albert Einstein.

Anyway he is the favourite to win with a possibility of Peter pulling off a surprise once campaign starts
7/31/22, 11:25 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Truly worth reading!
As much as I am thrilled about the candidacy of Peter Obi, he leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to his plans to tackle insecurity in Nigeria. As it stands, that is the biggest issue bedeviling Nigeria right now.
His plans for the economy trump those of the other candidates, but if he is not decisive with insecurity especially in the north, those bandits/herdsmen/terrorists will bring him to his knees if he becomes president.
Whoever wins this elections has to be even more ruthless than the bandits if they ever hope to defeat them. 
For now, I do not see that in any of the candidates.
7/31/22, 12:11 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Peter Obi has that track record

He ran out the Bakassi boys terrorising Anambra out of the state.

The famous kidnapper Evans said he left Anambra state because of Peter's decisiveness.

The upper Iweka Road in Onitsha was a hub for armed robbers and assassins. He dealt squarely with them. Now you can easily stay there at night without fear.

These things are verifiable because I come from that state.


Now onto the national issue he will do same. But he has not been vocal about it.

When asked about insecurity.  He says if you improve the economy insecurity will melt away.
 

While this is generally true in the long term I believe you want him to tackle them headon in the short term

One of the reasons I believe Peter doesn't want to state his full blueprint on banditry and boko haram is this:

If you remember when Goodluck started clearing out Boko haram. Buhari stated an attack on boko haram is an attack against the North.

When Major general Ihejirika was reclaiming the land captured by terrorists and wiping them out decisively.

What did some of the northern leaders do? 

Rather than be happy they told the electorates that Ihejirika is an igbo man and he is killing their people as a revenge for civil wars.
They now advocated for his removal.

So we have to call a spade a spade. How do we now expect Peter to unveil his decisive blueprint against insecurity. They will still use it against him in the election. That he is reanacting biafra on their soil.

If you doubt this assertion. Remember Buhari was in Daura 2 or 3 weeks ago.

Look at the mammoth crowd that welcomed him and were  praising him. A town ravaged by banditry. 

It was a shameful sight to behold. If Buhari comes out for 3rd them they will still vote him instead of someone competent due to ethno religious sentiment.

I believe this is why he doesn't want to reveal his full blueprint.

Even before he became Anambra governor he was asked similar question on insecurity and he was technical in his response. He was careful so that he will clinch the seat and he eventually delivered on that aspect.
7/31/22, 12:17 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Of course the other two candidates can't solve insecurity 


Shettima of APC a boko haram Patron housing Kabiru Sokoto a terrorist will not solve insecurity.

Atiku who deleted his tweet following the killing of Deborah because of religion will not solve insecurity.
He said 90% of Northerners who are his supporters are not on social media...yet he deleted his tweet because the remaining 10% criticised his tweet.


You can actually crush boko haram bandits and herdsmen in 3 weeks or less.

Many times when they are about to be captured or killed these soldiers get orders from above to stop advancing or withdraw.

Until we realise that the attempt is to grab land those affected will not sit up
7/31/22, 12:24 PM - +234 803 310 4903: At this point I think we shd not be punching holes in Peter Obi’s ambition. Even if he doesn’t have a plan for security he will never be as bad as the two other candidates. 
Tinubu would have been decent in tackling insecurity but the Muslim-Muslim ticket thing and the bringing in of a confirmed BokoHaram sponsor and sponsor of terrorism in the north east has discredited him. 
It’s Peter Obi or you guys in the diaspora shd forget about ever coming back to Nigeria because Buhari the grand Patron of Miyetti Allah is he’ll bent on changing Nigeria to Yemen so he and his herdsmen can remain in power. 
This is the reality on ground. I’m in abuja. We know what the real issues are.
7/31/22, 12:34 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yep

The real issue is land grabbing

You overbreed and populate the whole area and resources become scarce...you start going to kill villagers to collect their lands and kidnap people on the road so you can survive.

How someone from Nassarawa Benue and Plateau support APC/PDP with no plans to tackle insecurity beats imagination.

Those in the east supporting the party is largely due to stupidity and greed. I keep telling them what is saving you is DISTANCE. When they are done with middle belt they will face you fully in the east...

The Niger delta has less casualties because of this distance. It us the farthest away from these criminals
7/31/22, 12:42 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Exactly.
7/31/22, 12:45 PM - +234 803 310 4903: My take is after all this education if any fool comes here and opens his gutter to tell me to vote for Atiku or Tinubu after seeing all what is happening in Nigeria.. may the Nigeria that you, Buhari, Atiku and Tinubu have created happen to you and your family. 
Going to bed and sleeping with one eye open in the federal capital territory of the country which is suppose to be the most fortified territory is not just alarming but unimaginable. 
Since we all have decided not to have common sense in this country
7/31/22, 2:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Datti even said the things they've learned they can't say publicly but when they get into government they'll tackle it

I'm sure he's found the rot goes all the way to the top
7/31/22, 4:19 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: It’s not about poking holes. It’s just a genuine concern and an honest critique. I pray they give an honest thought to the security concerns with a view to tackling them.
7/31/22, 4:32 PM - +234 817 950 7218: He has hinted at a few things which I think sound reasonable.

He has spoken about short term and long term solutions.

In the shirt term he first spoke of negotiation. If you've watched the recent documentaries you'd find that even the bandits feel they have been maltreated and marginalized. Same as the farmers. 

The basic reality is that with desertification and population increase, available land is limited to satisfy both groups

So there needs to be some compromise. If he legitimately discusses with all groups with both sides agreeing to compromise the something can be reached.

The problem with Buhari is that he has taken the side of Fulani. He wants to simply give them grazing reserves ie other people's land and it can't work that way. It was rejected and nothing has changed

Obi has also said that after negotiation anyone still left in criminal life will be thoroughly dealt  with. Of course we know Fulani usually respect their leaders and if the leaders agree then it will go a long way

We all know the leaders currently agree with the banditry as a statement

PO was even asked about use of mercenaries and foreign help and he didn't rule it out. He simply said all options will be open

Government will to solve a crisis goes a long way. Buhari doesn't have the will and that is why it's a struggle.

On the long term he has the obvious. Once the economy improves and more people are gainfully earning a living. Recruitment for gangs will go down

Education on the longer term will even go a longer way

Security is not a walk in the park but in my opinion Peter Obi seems to have decent strategy and I expect that if he wins

By the end of his 2nd year there will be significant improvement. It won't happen overnight and there will be lots of saboteurs, but he is strong willed

As governor he sacked UpTo 5 police commissioners because they weren't delivering what he asked for

He's polite but not timid. He's actually a no nonsense man
7/31/22, 5:04 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: This is a bit reassuring. A strong willed person is what Nigeria needs now. Someone who is ready to step on all the “big toes” and face the repercussions full on. Those responsible for the current state of affairs will not let go without a fight. Therefore if PO wins, he must be ready.
7/31/22, 5:08 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Very astute analysis

You've obviously listened to him more because you and I had this mini debate in the past about his approach to security if I remember correctly

You weren't satisfied with his responses then but you're correct in your analysis of his approach

*Short term*
Dialogue
Negotiation

*Long term* 
Economy
Education

*Unrepentant bandits*

Maximum TIDY😂
7/31/22, 5:09 PM - +234 806 566 2895: And Chino in your very wonderful post you stated something very important people often miss about Peter Obi

He is very very strong willed. His humble demeanor belies strength of character that mostly hard to match

People are not great judges of character think he's weak
7/31/22, 5:10 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I have listened to almost every minute of his recent interviews

I have also listened fully to the one Atiku gave

Certainly security is key, because without that even his agricultural plan as the oil of the future can't work

Farms can't grow without security
7/31/22, 5:11 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: 😄 I actually prefer “maximum TIDY” from the get go. In fact, China and Saudi Arabia style. That said, any step in the right direction is welcome.

That will lead to all out war, because that's like genocide

There is a fundamental problem that has led to your citizens taking up arms, killing and kidnapping people anyhow.

Fulanis are Nigerian and have rights as well

The underlying problem needs to be addressed

Solving crime is always about root cause as opposed to the obvious end point crime
7/31/22, 5:14 PM - +234 817 950 7218: It's like in the US. They don't stop stealing by chasing thieves but by making it almost impossible to sell things you steal
7/31/22, 5:14 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂

You'd create more terrorists and martyrs with maximum TIDY approach at the outset

Bring them to the table and hear them out, spare lives of those with a reason for violence and those who continue shall receive no mercy

7/31/22, 5:15 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly

And I was encouraged he didn't discard the use of foreign security forces or assistance.

I get incensed everytime these new anchors bring up the matter. They think it's a trick question and it angers me because, there should be no limit to what a leader would do to secure lives of his people

Even if that means foreign aid
7/31/22, 5:16 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Onset*😟
7/31/22, 5:16 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Foreign security forces. Agreed

Remember Jonathan did that.

Those in the military sympathetic to boko haram were compromising the Foreign security forces by leaking out information to terrorists.

By that I mean military personnel that shared ethnic and religious sentiments with terrorists

This made the Foreign operatives to leave

Hopefully he takes note of that aspect
7/31/22, 5:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Of course he would

He'd start by rooting out sympathisers

Buhari can root out sympathisers if he wants to but he has to start with himself

So that's impossible

8/1/22, 12:54 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Muslim-Muslim Ticket A Long-Term Political Strategy For APC, Calculated Anti-Christian Exclusion Agenda -Lawal 
***
“We will not give up until we get Justice. I have heard friends and colleagues within and even outside the APC express some shock and even disbelieve over our reaction to the APC’s Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 general elections.

“Our opposition has some historical basis. There were times in the past when Christians produced the Deputy Governors in Kebbi, Niger and Kaduna States. Now it is wholly Muslim-Muslim tickets. It is worth noting that all these are happening in APC-controlled states. They are threatening to do likewise in Gombe, Kogi and Adamawa States.

“It is also now a recurring practice in the north, whereby any Christian traditional ruler that dies is replaced with a Muslim prince albeit from the ruling family even if the most qualified and preferred prince is a Christian. The recent case of Billiri Chiefdom in Gombe State is still fresh in our minds.

“Proof of its anti-Christian agenda is that our party itself has completely eliminated northern Christians from its National Working Committee (NWC) and National Executive Council (NEC). All our protestations as party members have been completely ignored by the party leadership. But as members of the APC, we have the right to continue to express our indignation at these happenings and will not give up until we secure the justice that is due us.

“The main purpose of this historical narrative is to let you know that for The APC, a Muslim-Muslim ticket has been a longterm political strategy and not a one-off decision. Thus, all these talk of competence as the reason for the choice of the Muslim VP is balderdash and diversionary. This is a calculated anti-Christian exclusion agenda that is being implemented.” -Engr. Babachir Lawal
8/1/22, 7:15 AM - +234 803 458 5862: *My sincere thoughts on 2023*
1. We are at a very critical time in the history of the nation, and national interest must be put above selfish and lame sectional bias.
2. Jimi Hendrix said once that we can only know peace when the *love for power* is conquered by the *power of love.* 
3. If I were Tinubu and Atiku,  I would have shelved my ambition for superior quality in leadership and an uncommon patriotic leadership template.
4. If we are truly one Nigeria, then we *MUST* show our Igbo "brothers" in this geo-political enclave that they are part of this country and are loved. Besides, they are not presenting a moron for consideration but a "7 feet tall" egghead! We must give them reason to believe that our unity is really "non-negotiable" 
5. Progress will only come, when the love for power is overcome by the power of love.

8/1/22, 9:21 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Females are more than males
8/1/22, 9:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Interesting sets of data.
8/1/22, 9:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It’s almost a ratio of 1:1 actually and it’s good to see women coming out like this.
8/1/22, 9:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They are the ones who go to the markets the most. We need them to speak thru the ballot
8/1/22, 9:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Done. 

Of the 12 million voters, c.a 11 million are less than 49.


C.a 4.5 million are students ffd next by biz men with over 2 million farmers and artisans with less than 2 million.
8/1/22, 9:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While I also love the disagregation by occupation I am a bit worried this can play into the hands of Govt
8/1/22, 9:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 4.5 million students is a lot and is largely achieved as a result of the strike and their idleness. This is one plus for the strike
8/1/22, 9:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: However a smart Govt will influence a strike call of
8/1/22, 9:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: To ensure students return to school just around the timing of the election
8/1/22, 9:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The structures people are expecting may be different from what will play out
8/1/22, 9:24 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This can water down that number
8/1/22, 9:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I also like the balance of numbers between the north and the south. While the unusually low turn outs in the north can be associated with the recent insecurities
8/1/22, 9:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The alternative improvement in registration in the south is sort of a protest movement
8/1/22, 9:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let’s hope for the best outcome for our nation
8/1/22, 9:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: True, but a smart student should travel home Thursday or Friday night to vote Saturday Morning. 

The safety and security on the roads may be a factor but the Nigerian spirit in them which is obidient will defy any odds
8/1/22, 9:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes
8/1/22, 9:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Nice. I'm surprised at the civil servants for the low turnout.

Maybe, just maybe they made a substantial no of the earlier registered voters.

One would expect the ones owed salaries who champion the inherent resolve for change
8/1/22, 9:28 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Realistically If this be the case with resumption, that number will drop by approx 20-30%
8/1/22, 9:29 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you assume that 50-60% of students sxhool within the geopolitical zone
8/1/22, 9:29 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Another 20% school in a Geopolitical zone Contigous to theirs
8/1/22, 9:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And the remaining cris-cros the country and won’t be able to make the trip back
8/1/22, 9:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes. The elections are 7 months away. Campaigns start Sept ending
8/1/22, 9:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This should realistically bring it down to 6 million. That can sway the votes in any direction
8/1/22, 9:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: God bring us to the desirable end 🙏🏼
8/1/22, 9:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Amen

8/1/22, 9:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Atiku recorded 12 million votes in 2019 and I think lost his ward. Now we have 12 million voters who have never voted before. 

Interesting times...
8/1/22, 9:43 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Then it is a 2 ways election, now it is a 4 ways depending on if Kwankwaso is actually contesting or just securing kano governorship seat for his inlaw

The first is majorly Buhari and some terrorists who have infiltrated the army...giving out compromising information to the bandits, terrorists and herdsmen 


Second is the top military leaders looting the security funds

Now the VP has confirmed it.

@2348065662895  see how Seun kept pushing for about 3 times to state their security blueprint he refused to say it.

It felt he wanted to provoke Peter Obi to talk out of turn
8/2/22, 1:57 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Absolutely no shishi men
8/2/22, 1:58 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yeah that was the aim

And I think it's Tinubu working behind the scenes on that interview
8/2/22, 1:58 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol
8/2/22, 1:59 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I was suspicious of the approach

"Eh this person said this about you" 🤷🏿‍♂️

Repeatedly Peter Obi told him it didn't matter to him, yet
8/2/22, 2:00 AM - +234 806 566 2895: A less polite person would have either warned or exited the interview
8/2/22, 4:27 AM - +234 806 761 6952: But is it not a flaw on the voters electoral registrar? They should be thinking like people in a digital age not analogue.  If people could use their ATM cards any where regardless of where it was obtained. Why can't the voters card be same ? 🤷🏾‍♂️ why put people's lives in arms way when they could voter wherever they are regardless of where they where registered? It doesn't make sense 😕.

8/2/22, 9:54 AM - +234 810 006 7926: The process can be improved upon definitely but with the present circumstances,we cannot sit back and give excuses while the politicians take advantage.

It would be lovely to see Nigerian households have proper house addresses and area codes, so people vote via mails. 
Electronic voting is not too far from us.

With 15 million Nigerians in the diaspora that remit 40 billion USD per year should vote.

All these are desirable outcomes that have been frustrated by the current leaders.

When this set bows out, we can have a new set, and everything will take its course.

I don't see a reason why your voters card cannot be printed immediately you register and your verified not to have registered twice.

We will get there. But for now, any student who is 'obidient' should not wait back in school when others have travelled down to vote.

I’m asking for some help. I would be grateful if anyone here has been involved in any way with a project, procedure where male and female clients provide Seminal fluid… Those in fertility may have a clue. If you have clear guidelines or an SOP please share to my DM. If you have specific tools you use, either Magazines or videos, I would like to know, if they come in with their partners, I would also like to know. I just want to determine what is standard practice in Nigeria. Additionally, I’d be delighted to walk in and take a look at the unit, tools or point of collection as the case may be(*Preferrably if the said clinic is in Abuja*) . Any connections will be highly appreciated. 

Thank you.

8/6/22, 1:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: He is also very cerebral. I don’t know his antecedents and may have to look that up. But am wondering why the comparison is being made between the responses of a presidential candidate and that of a vice candidate. I also do think that The Obi/ Yusuf team have addressed this issue countless times, so there is a bit of suspect as to the intention of picking this particular response of Yusuf for the marsh up. I think he just demonstrated a lot of emotional intelligence there as well as a preservation of the integrity of their blue print. 
I also recall in that interview he said “enough of talking” people have said a whole lot and nothing came out of it.
8/6/22, 1:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In conclusion, I have utmost respect for you @2348066751526 and your commitment to the SDP. It is exemplary. However, as regards the Presidential race, I’ll enjoin the SDP to collapse it’s structure with the LP for that office, run credible candidates for other offices too and together we build this country. Additionally, I believe that the Obi- Datti team will welcome constructive ideas from cerebral persons like your principal
8/6/22, 1:48 PM - +234 806 529 3872: Talk is Cheap.
Datti answer is cool.
Lots of people have said plenty and did nothing in the end.

8/6/22, 2:21 PM - +44 7466 095552: 😂😂😂😂 Arome my man, this guy said nothing. In fact his answer is the empty nothing that Datti alluded to when he said politicians can talk and say anything
8/6/22, 2:21 PM - +44 7466 095552: What impressed you with his answer question please? What was cerebral about the answer?

8/6/22, 5:40 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I would rather think the Obi/ Datti team knows how deep and bad the security challenges are and would rather keep it up their sleeves until they get to power.

I would rather think it is smart at this point in time to be discreet about your solutions than say it on national TV and our common enemy knows your next move.

It is a game of chess. It is better your enemies don't see you coming than to predict what you would do and cannot do, based on your perceived antecedents from interviews
8/6/22, 6:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Solid points
8/6/22, 6:23 PM - +44 7466 095552: Exactly!! This is the most obvious point. We know our security apparatus has been compromised. We know there are powerful, powerful men in positions of power who are behind the security challenges in the northeast. I don’t know who expects anyone to say exactly what their plan is. It’s the same generic rubbish anyone will say, but this time Datti decided to skip the nonsense.
8/6/22, 6:24 PM - +44 7466 095552: It’s not that difficult to understand 🤷🏽‍♂️

8/10/22, 10:33 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Look at the names.

Mostly Ebira ethnicity.

It doesn't make sense that they will just come to Owo in Ondo state and kill people and go.


Pay attention to number 4 on the list Idris Ojo

These military assume Nigerians are stupid.... I don't blame. Afterall we have people trying to support criminals in 2023
8/10/22, 10:37 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Number 4 Idris Ojo.

They claim he is among the killers.

Owo attack occurred in June.

Idris escaped from Kuje in July


So does it mean that while Idris was in prison in June he went and killed people and returned to back to prison....so he can escape in July.


Well our leaders know that most Nigerians are incapable of reasoning....especially when you bring religion and tribe into the mix.


We get the leaders we deserve

8/10/22, 10:46 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Question remains 
How is it that one of them was in the prison when the killings happened?

So after the killing he went back to prison only to escape again
8/10/22, 10:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: That is why when they parade IPOB suspects I laugh...

Criminal security outfits
8/10/22, 10:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I tell you

The conspiracy is so deeply rooted
8/10/22, 10:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Na the Nigerians trusting them that deserve pity
8/10/22, 10:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Mtscheeew
8/10/22, 10:48 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Very rooted

Then when you try to explain to those affected they will be there talking another thing

Everybody go learn
8/10/22, 10:49 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Jokers. Always arresting to other people and forcing them to confess what they didn't do. They can arrest other criminals but shouldn't label them with crimes they didn't commit. I read the article and was surprised too. Church massacre happened in June, and prison break took place in July and they are here labelling someone that just broke out of prison to be responsible for Owo killings?
8/10/22, 10:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: That's there modus operandi na.

Owerri angle
8/12/22, 1:40 PM - +234 806 329 9675: BVAS vs ballot papers. What is the difference ABEG? I don't want mistake on the day of election ooooo😳
8/12/22, 1:51 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think BVAS is the software for recognition of your iris and finger prints during Accreditation and uploading of results from the polling unit to a cloud .

The ballot paper is for thumb printing candidates of your choice.

Nota bene the ballot papers will have to be folded properly to prevent the thumb print from staining another box when folded so as to prevent double voting and invalidating the votes.

Also the thumb print *must* be within the box for *LP*( on the day it will be LP not Labour party), otherwise if it crosses over to the box up or down, it would be invalidated as The INEC cannot say which party was actually voted for.

Mistakes must be minimized to optimize the chances of the LP( Obi/Datti) ticket
8/12/22, 1:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Now you will vote immediately you have been accredited. You don't have to walk home and comeback to vote.

And now after the votes have been counted and verified by All Party Agents, it will be hoisted to the INEC cloud and accessible by All, so it minimises to puts an end to ballot snatching and stuffing of boxes before it gets to the collation centers.

The spine of the transparent elections is results from the polling units gotten immediately after voting from the polling units. This is the adv of the BVAS
8/12/22, 1:58 PM - +234 806 329 9675: Thanks
8/12/22, 3:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I truly enjoy his video and listening to the different languages spoken

8/13/22, 11:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The Let me try to tell you what will most likely happen in an overpopulated country with serious economic crises:

Stage 1 - The Exodus Phase: prices increase; people can no longer afford the basics and resort to "begging." The rich notice this trend and get scared.

The rich can afford to leave the country and they are the first to use the door. They leave in mass with their resources and things grow worse.

Stage 2 - The Agitation Phase: Prices continue to gallop. At this stage, the middle class is now broke. A lot of people are in debt. Companies start to close down, reducing the employment rate. At this stage, those with mental and technical skill will try to use their skills as doorway to exit the country. I think this is where your country is at the moment.

Stage 3 - Famine Phase: the citizens will start clamouring for the impeachment of their leaders. Feeding three times a day becomes a luxury.

In this phase, people will resort to kidnapping, armed robbery, etc

Law enforcement will try to maintain order but the population is too large to control.

At this phase, the few individuals who can still leave the country will leave. There will be small riots, curfews, protests, and politicians will no longer be able to walk freely in public.

The penultimate stage, Survival of the Fittest:

Here, schooling is going to stop, the government will try to shut down the internet, nationwide protests, and violence everywhere majorly in state capitals and areas with dense populations which may eventually become a war.

The final stage, The Readjustment Phase:

After the war and/or civil unrest, new governments will be formed, there will be new treaties, and maybe secession. Foreign aid will be wide, those who left during the Exodus Phase will return and things gradually return to normal.

Happiness is free.

You can call it a form of spiritual exercise 

The gods approve.
8/14/22, 7:02 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This is how things will be done now.

Hold screen every word and statements made by politicians.

Like the word Fact check.
Every word now and statements of reference will be subjected to fact checks.

When someone lies just to prove a point in his favour, then that person will lie about anything when he gets there.

The candidates and their spokesperson who lie before elections, will lie when they get there.

By their fruits you will know them.

Like the Barean church we must go back and check every word, every record and past medial and social history of every candidate

In my experience it's not as confusing as I thought it'd be
8/14/22, 7:43 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Really hope so

Because similar thing happened this year in an LG election in plateau 


PDP won there...but the party that came second was PRP....in a state where the governor is APC.
8/14/22, 7:44 AM - +234 806 566 2895: People already know Peter Obi is not in PDP

That's the first plus and they know PDP is umbrella

What we need to do is let them know LP
8/14/22, 7:46 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Beautiful read.

A person who could not win his senatorial seat cannot win or sell his principal to Nigerians. 

The brick Bart's between Dino and Keyamo will be revealing and de marketing their pricipals.

LP spokesperson should not make d mistake of responding to any of these two moral derelicts. The focus should be on deliverables.

PO has done well with responding to other candidates raising eyebrows and making LP feel very inferior, and he should continue.

Like I said in this season, Tinubu showed up to cancel Atiku and Atiku manifested to cancel Tinubu, so the rising of PO will be known to All.

Welcome to the future here today.
8/14/22, 7:56 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This is enlightening and you are damn right.

Some of the senior citizens may have difficulty with colours with their sight.

And for those that may not be able to read and write LP may be difficult to recognize moreso with a poor eyesight.

Though the youths will make a greater chunk of those coming out to vote, those in the rural areas have consistently shown they can be relied upon, come rain or sunshine to queue to cast their votes.

Very revealingly piece.
8/14/22, 7:56 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True

Dino and Keyamo should continue to fight dirty

The show will be fun🤣

LP spokesman should be issue based

They should leave the fighting for us 😃
8/14/22, 7:56 AM - +234 810 006 7926: 🤣🤣

8/14/22, 10:19 AM - +44 7466 095552: 😂😂 Abegi, You guys need to stop this infantilisation of people in rural communities. They are poor, not stupid. They may not know what the logo is, but there is sensitisation going on. Saying they won’t be able to differentiate the logo from an umbrella is doing them a disservice 😃
8/14/22, 10:37 AM - +234 817 034 1232: No wahala na

Same way a switch from PDP to PCP made a party come 3rd in the general election 4 years ago. Just letter C

Same way a switch from PDP to PRP almost cost PDP an election 4 months ago with a slim margin...just a letter R.

Underestimate these things at your own peril😃


The day of election is not just presidential election....if it were I wouldn't have been bothered because the sensitisation will gain strong hold.

But that day involves both presidential and National Assembly election. The people that will engage in the trick of confusion will be the senators and house of rep members who will  tell them the logos are similar and this is where they should thumbprint

Governorship election is 2 weeks later


Those in the rural areas account for bulk of the votes
8/14/22, 10:40 AM - +44 7466 095552: True. But the logos are not similar. Test they have a similar colour scheme, but that is all. 
It can be as simple as telling people LP is the ‘family’ logo, or something like that. Same way they reduced Pdp to umbrella and AC to broom. It’s not that complicated
8/14/22, 10:45 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True.

You are well lettered and have the mental capacity on that day to vote LP as President. You can decide to vote PDP candidate as a senator or an APC candidate as house of rep.

You can make that distinction because of your intellect....many in rural areas may not.


Well my advice is this to avoid complications on that day....apart from logo sensitisation is that both in rural and urban areas should vote anything LP on that day....whether President senators and house of rep.... afterall the current crop don't deserve it.

When the head is good the rest of the body will naturally follow.
8/14/22, 10:47 AM - +44 7466 095552: Ah, I now understand your point 😃
8/14/22, 10:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: They should just tick LP across all open positions
8/14/22, 10:47 AM - +44 7466 095552: That one Dey sha. Just vote LP across board to avoid stories that touch.
8/14/22, 10:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Gbam😃
8/14/22, 10:47 AM - +44 7466 095552: Gbam’!
8/14/22, 10:56 AM - +234 806 566 2895: PDP and PCP is very easy to understand. Some might even say it was deliberate attempt by PCP 

The logo is harder. I can't deny there's a chance this would happen but it's infinitesimal, in light of the current efforts
8/14/22, 11:58 AM - +234 817 271 4735: *ELECTION OF NEW OFFICIALS*

The NMA Taraba held her AGM and elections yesterday, Saturday, August 13, 2022.

The following officers are the members of the 2022 - 2024 State Officers Committee (SOC).

1. Dr. Bako, Ali Istifanus Chairman 08032692652
2. Dr. Kara, Adamu Hamidu 
3. Dr. Dou, Baren Sambo Secretary 07084368028
4. Dr. Uba, Gabriel Ahmed Assistant Secretary
5. Dr. Hunuato, Isaiah Treasurer
6. Dr. Edeh, Michael Financial Secretary
7. Dr. Godlove, Mary Public Relations Officer
8. Dr. Atizwen, Daniel Bitrus Auditor

8/14/22, 12:00 PM - +234 806 965 1788: Congratulations Chief Baren
8/14/22, 12:02 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Congratulations Dr Dou. Have a peaceful and prosperous tenure
8/14/22, 12:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Happy Sunday to everyone. 

The points made by Chibuzo and Ezeami are all solid points and based on clear premises or antecedents. 
One arrow that shoots down all the birds as suggested is to vote LP across board.  We are beginning to buy into the voting of candidates as opposed to parties but until this mentality cascades down to all levels, it is safe to say vote LP across board. 
Again Ezeamis assertions about the street wisdom of the rural area holds credibility. While poverty limits access to spaces that improve cognitive and integrated decision making skills, it doesn’t blunt clarity of perception especially where factors influencing wellbeing and better judgement is concerned. 

Yours in OBidience!!!
8/14/22, 12:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Voting LP across board is the goal to get Obi to the top. Any credible PDP or APC candidate who loses out as a result becomes collateral damage.
8/14/22, 12:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Beautiful analysis. Shows  you are grounded in politics
8/14/22, 12:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This election is likely to be very close and parties will loose out due to pre election matters prior to the elections that contravened the 2022 Electoral act, mistakes like invalid votes, citizens voting for a different party when they actually meant to vote another party.

We must minimize mistakes to optimize the chances of the LP. That's the moral of Chibuzor's revelation and believe me it would be worked upon .

Anything and I mean anything that should be done to make Peter Obi and his team to preside over our affairs *will* be done.

Well-done Chibuzor, I liked the fact you used  facts from previous elections to highlight your observations which are genuine and won't be taken likely
8/14/22, 12:58 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Nice submit
8/14/22, 12:58 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Congratulations Baren. You been one humble politician and I know NMA Taraba will have value addition in the coming two years.

8/14/22, 2:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Solid points. Great to see him discussing the real issues
8/14/22, 2:15 PM - +234 806 675 1526: He has always been discussing the real issues. We have only chosen not to pay attention to them.
8/14/22, 2:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: On the contrary, we are very much aware of how valuable his insights are. We are paying attention. But just like every endeavor in life,  choices have to be made and while he is a good choice, there is better and there is best. I really don’t know much about his antecedents or positions where the final ball has been on his table. It’s like making me choose between Rashford and Mbappe. I’ll doff my 🎩 for Rashford and give him all the credit. But I’ll probably still buy Mbappe. In the end, I take responsibility again for my purchase.
8/14/22, 4:50 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Well, everything boils down to subjectivism. The parameters with which I judge an individual best may not be tantamount to the barometer with which another may judge the same individual. 

I have long understood politics to be a game of interest and selfish biases. People defend their interests and biases as it reflects on the faces of those they assume will protect them, sometimes at ridiculous costs. 

My proudest plume yet is that everyone is suddenly electrified and interested in who governs them, and this sets a novel tune towards national recovery. 

Let the best candidate win and I think prince Adeboya Adewole is that candidate. He more than ADEquate.
8/14/22, 4:56 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Solid points raised comrade. As long as humans are involved, interest and biases cannot be totally eliminated.
8/14/22, 5:49 PM - +234 703 714 8734: MUSINGS FROM THE OTHER SIDE...

"Atiku betrayed PDP in 2015, Wike fixed it. In 2019 Atiku again came back and benefitted from the PDP that he destroyed. After the 2019 elections Atiku ran away to Dubai, Wike again fixed the party only for Atiku to return back and PDP betrayed Wike because of Atiku. If I'm in Wike's shoes I will also betray PDP and Atiku. After all no one has the monopoly of betrayal."

8/16/22, 8:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If Tinubu becomes president cultists, Touts, Gangs will become our leaders. Corruption will be glorified 

If Atiku becomes president mediums, witches shall rule in our affairs. Corruption will be personified.

We need a president who is anointed and God fearing and that person is not Tinubu nor Atiku nor Kwankwaso. That person is Peter Obi.

He is the rock, and the family( Father, mother and Child) is the bedrock of the new Nigerian Renaissance

By David Hundeyin 

Aug 10, 2022

I seem to begin a lot of my columns with anecdotes from the 1990s, and this one will be no different. It’s not formulaic, I promise – it’s just that the 90s were my childhood years and I learned a great deal of what I know now during those glorious, nostalgia-tinted years that I now remember with fondness, while most Nigerians remember them as the “Abacha stove” era. Anyway, I digress.

In 1999, shortly after the economic wilderness that was the Abacha era, there was a rich dude who died. Hardly headline news, because rich people die everyday, right? Well, here’s the thing – Victor Nnmadi Okafor was not just any rich man.

He was a man with so much wealth that he obtained the Igbo nickname “Ezego,” which literally translates as “King of Money.” At the age of 35, Victor Ezego had everything most red-blooded Nigerian men aspire to – successful business chains, an eye-popping fleet of cars, various comely damsels warming his bed, reportedly over 70 houses across Nigeria, and generally a lifestyle that could only be described as “violently opulent.”

And then one day, there was a pothole.

For want of a nail, and all that
While celebrating Christmas in 1999, Victor decided to drive himself from Lagos to Enugu. He hardly ever drove himself, but that day he decided to do so, ostensibly to enjoy the unique dopamine rush that comes behind the wheel of an expensive car with a powerful engine – in this case a Jeep Cherokee. The car chose that day of all days to break down along the way, and he ended up having to tow it from Asaba with another car.

A few kilometres from Ihiala, disaster struck. Having driven fast into a big pothole, he apparently forgot that he was towing about 2 tons of free-rolling SUV behind him and he hit the brakes. The Jeep Cherokee – his pride and joy that he himself drove from Lagos that morning – plowed into the back of the Lexus he was in, violently launching his head into the reinforced glass windshield. A few hours later, despite his convoys best efforts, the “King of Money” was dead. What killed him? An incurable genetic disease? A destructive war? A powerful business rival? None of those things – just a regular, unimpressive Nigerian pothole.

18 years later in June 2017, I would experience my own “pothole” moment when I sat helplessly on a sofa inside a house valued north of N500 million and watched its owner – my dad – die in front of me. The reason? The ambulance just didn’t show up in time. That’s it.

There was no huge, dramatic event that took place. The 66-year-old man simply suffered a survivable stroke, and then the 112 ambulance service in Lagos simply didn’t show up for nearly 2 hours. When it did eventually deign to show up, it was only to examine his corpse, confirm his death and casually inform me, “We don’t carry corpses.”

For want of a smooth road, Victor Ezego died along with all that he was. For want of an ambulance, D.F. Hundeyin died on his marble living room floor. Whatever those men were or had achieved meant absolutely nothing to Nigeria – when it decides to happen to anyone, it happens with contemptuous ease that makes a total mockery of one’s achievements and attempts at self insulation. I made that realisation that day in 2017, but here we are in 2022 and it seems as though the message really has not got through yet.

*Bad governance will not spare you – even if you are part of the government*

Whenever I speak to old friends and school alumni who have aligned themselves with certain politicians and power structures that I personally find unconscionable, they always laugh and give me variants of the same answer – “Bros, wetin man go do?”

The reasoning is that those who wield power will do so with or without them, so instead of becoming an exiled refugee like me, they would rather quietly fall in line, kiss the ring and get something out of it for themselves.

Some of my friends have multiple garbage collection contracts in Lagos, which is apparently one of the most common rewards for displaying fealty to the Emperor of Bourdillon Road. Others have supply contracts for government agencies.

Some operate as middlemen in processes that do not require middlemen, for the sole purpose of generating “jobs for the boys” through Nigeria’s famously generous public pork barrel. After getting all this, some even go into electoral politics for the singular purpose of entrenching themselves forever into Nigeria’s public purse.

To such people, Nigeria is not a horribly governed, unsecured space going through an existential crisis, but a wonderful land of opportunity. This lot love Nigeria more than anyone reading this article, and why wouldn’t they? It’s working for them – or so they think.

The problem is that Nigeria is such a tragedy of horrors now, that anyone who thinks they have “figured it out” and can ride the growling green-white-green tiger is genuinely delusional.

I know this because my dad was one such person. He never put his hands anywhere near the public purse or compromised his ethical principles, but he thought he had figured out a system for keeping Nigeria and its uncertainties away from his family’s door.

Electricity? 35kVA Marapco diesel generator with a 1,000 litre external tank. Water? Grandiose borehole with twin underground and twin overhead tanks equipped with 2-step filtration devices. Poor security? Double-gated GRA estate security, electrified fence with 1-metre barbed wire, alarm system and halogen security lights. Poor healthcare? Go private at Eko and Reddington. Education? Same thing. And on and on and on lies that.

Then an ambulance probably didn’t have enough petrol and thus didn’t show up on time one day.

And that was that……

Tactically schools are shutting down, we would be shut from the outside world as no one can fly in. Power supply has failed.

I just have a feeling we are deliberately precipitating to the Afghanistan scenario and there might be a grand plan for terrorists to take over the seat of power without any resistance.

I may be wrong, but I have this strong feeling Buhari knows what he is doing. Make the country ungovernable, no elections, And Afghan experience is instilled

He challenged anybody and that the money deposited with Dele Momodu(obviously another joker)


People have come up with the cash including this guy on live video.

Deji is now ignoring their message and calls and lying to other people that these guys with cash are the ones running away.


Anyway call logs and messages with timestamps have shown that Deji is the liar.

He doesn't even have raw cash 10,000 dollars to even show on live video for a start.

He is probably waiting for Atiku or Tinubu to credit him first😃

So if the guy had deposited his money based on the terms of the bet, Dele Momodu would have denied later saying it was campaign donation 😂

This is a candidate who isn't even running and lost at primaries

On top of that Deji did not have the money.

Atiku doesn't have a voting block currently. His northern support is fickle, SS and SE are gone, MB is probably also gone. SW and parts of the core North are Tinubu's.

His sense of entitlement having 'helped' his political neophytes is so irritating and dumbfounding.

You pushed and sold Buhari to Nigerians because you felt, it will become your turn when he leaves.

Thugs have become glorified and will be amplified under one who will have a field day under one of their own.

Imagine kids competing to be the best in school and the world only for a thug to become their governor or Boss at work.

This is not to say Nigeria won't become like a mini Colombia headed by Drug cartels.

He has Alzheimer's and his camp will do everything to hide it from Nigerians.

Tinubu is not fit physically, emotionally, mentally to preside over our homes, families and future of our kids.

If a man will do anything to bring a fake prophet to prove a point, he will do anything to explain his failure when he becomes a president he will never be.

8/22/22, 4:40 PM - +234 706 647 6470: *PONTIUS PILATE'S LETTER TO TIBERIUS CAESAR RELATING HIS ENCOUNTER WITH JESUS.*

This Shocking piece makes for thoughtful contemplation during Holy Week on Pilate's terrible dilemma.

          (Christ Beforrle Pilate)
 
*Historical document: Pontius Pilate's Letter to Tiberius Caesar verifying his sympathy for Jesus Christ and exposing the treachery of the Jews.*

*(From The Archko Volume, or The Archeological Writings of the Sanhedrin and Talmuds of the Jews, entered into the Congressional Record in the year 1887. Republished in 1975 by Keats Publishing Inc., 27 Pine Street, New Canaan Conn. 06840, USA.)*

*To Noble Tiberius Caesar, Emperor of Rome.*

Noble Sovereign, Greeting: The events of the last few days in my province have been of such a character that I will give the details in full as they occurred, as I should not be surprised if, in the course of time, they may change the destiny of our nation, for it seems of late that all the gods have ceased to be propitious. I am almost ready to say, Cursed be the day that I succeeded Vallerius Flaceus in the government of Judea; for since then my life has been one of continual uneasiness and distress.

On my arrival at Jerusalem I took possession of the praetorium, and ordered a splendid feast to be prepared, to which I invited the tetrarch of Galilee, with the high priest and his officers. At the appointed hour no guests appeared. This I considered an insult offered to my dignity, and to the whole government which I represent. 

A few days after, the high priest deigned to pay me a visit. His deportment was grave and deceitful. He pretended that his religion forbade him and his attendants to sit at the table with the Romans, and eat and offer libations with them, but this was only a sanctimonious seeming, for his very countenance betrayed his hypocrisy. 

Although I thought it expedient to accept his excuse, from that moment I was convinced that the conquered had declared themselves the enemy of the conquerors; and I would warn the Romans to beware of the high priests of this country. They would betray their own mother to gain office and a luxurious living.

It seems to me that, of conquered cities, Jerusalem is the most difficult to govern. So turbulent are the people that I live in momentary dread of an insurrection. I have not soldiers sufficient to suppress it. I had only one centurion and a hundred men at my command. 

I requested a reinforcement from the prefect of Syria, who informed me that he had scarcely enough troops sufficient to defend his own province. An insatiate thirst for conquest to extend our empire beyond the means of defending it, I fear, will be the cause of the final overthrow of our whole government. 

I lived secluded from the masses, for I did not know what those priests might influence the rabble to do; yet I endeavored to ascertain, as far as I could, the mind and standing of the people.

Among the various rumors that came to my ears, there was one in particular that attracted my attention. A young man, it was said, had appeared in Galilee, preaching with a noble unction a new law in the name of the God that had sent him. At first I was apprehensive that his design was to stir up the people against the Romans, but my fears were soon dispelled. Jesus of Nazareth spoke rather as friend of the Romans than of the Jews.

One day in passing by the place of Siloe, where there was a great concourse of people, I observed in the midst of the group a young man who was leaning against a tree, calmly addressing the multitude. I was told it was Jesus. This I could easily have suspected, so great was the difference between him and those listening to him. His golden-colored hair and beard gave to his appearance a celestial aspect. 

*He appeared to be about thirty years of age. Never have I seen a sweeter or more serene countenance.* What a contrast between him and his hearers, with their black beards and tawny complexions!

Unwilling to interrupt him by my presence, I continued my walk, but signified to my secretary to join the group and listen. My secretary's name is Manlius. He is the grandson of the chief of the conspirators who encamped in Etruria waiting for Cataline. Manlius had been for a long time an inhabitant of Judea, and is well acquainted with the Hebrew language. 

He was devoted to me, and worthy of my confidence. On entering the praetorium I found Manlius, who related to me the words Jesus had pronounced at Siloe. Never have I read in the works of the philosophers anything that can compare to the maxims of Jesus. One of the rebellious Jews, so numerous in Jerusalem, having asked Jesus if it was lawful to give tribute to Caesar, he replied, "Render unto Caesar the things that belong to Caesar, and unto God the things that are God's."

It was on account of the wisdom of his sayings that I granted so much liberty to the Nazarene; for it was in my power to have had him arrested, and exiled to Pontus; but that would have been contrary to the justice which has always characterized the Roman government in all its dealings with men; this man was neither seditious nor rebellious; I extended to him my protection, unknown perhaps to himself. 

He was at liberty to act, to speak, to assemble and address the people, and to choose disciples, unrestrained by any praetorian mandate. Should it ever happen (may the gods avert the omen!), should it ever happen, I say, that the religion of our forefathers will be supplanted by the religion of Jesus, it will be to this noble toleration that Rome shall owe her premature death, while I, miserable wretch, will have been the instrument of what the Jews call Providence, and we call destiny.

This unlimited freedom granted to Jesus provoked the Jews--not the poor, but the rich and powerful. It is true, Jesus was severe on the latter, and this was a political reason, in my opinion, for not restraining the liberty of the Nazarene. "Scribes and Pharisees," he would say to them, "you are a race of vipers; you resemble painted sepulchres; you appear well unto men, but you have death within you." At other times he would sneer at the alms of the rich and proud, telling them that the mite of the poor was more precious in the sight of God. Complaints were daily made at the praetorium against the insolence of Jesus.

I was informed that some misfortune would befall him; that it would not be the first time that Jerusalem had stoned those who called themselves prophets; an appeal would be made to Caesar. However, my conduct was approved by the Senate, and I was promised a reinforcement after the termination of the Parthian war.

Being too weak to suppress an insurrection, I resolved upon adopting a measure that promised to restore the tranquility of the city without subjecting the praetorium to humiliating concession. I wrote to Jesus, requesting an interview with him at the praetorium. He came. You know that in my veins flows the Spanish mixed with Roman blood--as incapable of fear as it is of weak emotion. When the Nazarene made his appearance, I was walking in my basilic, and my feet seemed fastened with an iron hand to the marble pavement, and I trembled in every limb as does a guilty culprit, though the Nazarene was as calm as innocence itself.

When he came up to me, he stopped, and by a signal sign he seemed to say to me, "I am here," though he spoke not a word. For some time I contemplated with admiration and awe this extraordinary type of man--a type of man unknown to our numerous painters, who have given form and figure to all the gods and the heroes. There was nothing about him that was repelling in its character, yet I felt too awed and tremulous to approach him.

"Jesus," said I unto him at last--and my tongue faltered--"Jesus of Nazareth, for the last three years I have granted you ample freedom of speech; nor do I regret it. Your words are those of a sage. I know not whether you have read Socrates or Plato, but this I know, there is in your discourses a majestic simplicity that elevates you far above those philosophers. The Emperor is informed of it, and I, his humble representative in this country, am glad of having allowed you that liberty of which you are so worthy. However, I must not conceal from you that your discourses have raised up against you powerful and inveterate enemies.

"Nor is this surprising. Socrates had his enemies, and he fell a victim to their hatred. Yours are doubly incensed--against you on account of your discourses being so severe upon their conduct; against me on account of the liberty I have afforded you. They even accuse me of being indirectly leagued with you for the purpose of depriving the Hebrews of the little civil power, which Rome has left them. My request--I do not say my order--is, that you be more circumspect and moderate in your discourses in the future, and more considerate of them, lest you arouse the pride of your enemies, and they raise against you the stupid populace, and compel me to employ the instruments of law."

The Nazarene calmly replied, "Prince of the earth, your words proceed not from true wisdom. Say to the torrent to stop in the midst of the mountain-gorge; it will uproot the trees of the valley. The torrent will answer you that it obeys the laws of nature and the creator. God alone knows whither flow the waters of the torrent. Verily I say unto you, before the rose of Sharon blossoms, the blood of the Just shall be spilt."

"Your blood shall not be spilt," said I with deep emotion; "you are more precious in my estimation on account of your wisdom than all the turbulent and proud Pharisees who abuse the freedom granted them by the Romans. They conspire against Caesar, and convert his bounty into fear, impressing the unlearned that Caesar is a tyrant and seeks their ruin. Insolent wretches! They are not aware that the wolf of the Tiber sometimes clothes himself with the skin of the sheep to accomplish his wicked designs. I will protect you against them. My praetorium shall be an asylum, sacred both day and night."

Jesus carelessly shook his head, and said with a grave and divine smile: "When the day shall have come, there will be no asylums for the son of man, neither in the earth nor under the earth. The asylum of the just is there," pointing to the heavens. "That which is written in the books of the prophets must be accomplished."

"Young man," I answered mildly, "you will oblige me to convert my request into an order. The safety of the province, which has been confided to my care, requires it. You must observe more moderation in your discourses. Do not infringe my order. You know the consequences. May happiness attend you; farewell."

"Prince of the earth," replied Jesus, "I come not to bring war into the world, but peace, love, and charity. I was born the same day on which Augustus gave peace to the Roman world. Persecutions proceed not from me. I expect it from others, and will meet it in obedience to the will of my Father, who has shown me the way. Restrain, therefore, your worldly prudence. It is not in your power to arrest the victim at the foot of the tabernacle of expiation."

So saying, he disappeared like a bright shadow behind the curtain of the basilic--to my great relief, for I felt a heavy burden on me, of which I could not relieve myself while in his presence.

To Herod, who then reigned in Galilee, the enemies of Jesus addressed themselves, to wreak their vengeance on the Nazarene. Had Herod consulted his own inclinations, he would have ordered Jesus immediately to be put to death; but, though proud of his royal dignity, yet he hesitated to commit an act that might lessen his influence with the Senate, or, like me, was afraid of Jesus. But it would never do for a Roman officer to be scared by a Jew. Previously to this, Herod called on me at the praetorium, and, on rising to take leave, after some trifling conversation, asked me what was my opinion concerning the Nazarene. I replied that Jesus appeared to me to be one of those great philosophers that great nations sometimes produced; that his doctrines were by no means sacrilegious, and that the intentions of Rome were to leave him to that freedom of speech which was justified by his actions. Herod smiled maliciously, and, saluting me with ironical respect, departed.

The great feast of the Jews was approaching, and the intention was to avail themselves of the popular exultation which always manifests itself at the solemnities of a Passover. The city was overflowing with a tumultuous populace, clamoring for the death of the Nazarene. My emissaries informed me that the treasure of the temple had been employed in bribing the people. The danger was pressing. A Roman centurion had been insulted. I wrote to the Prefect of Syria for a hundred foot-soldiers and as many cavalry. He declined.

I saw myself alone with a handful of veterans in the midst of a rebellious city, too weak to suppress an uprising, and having no choice left but to tolerate it. They had seized upon Jesus, and the seditious rabble, although they had nothing to fear from the praetorium, believing, as their leaders had told them, that I winked at their sedition--continued vociferating: "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"

Three powerful parties had combined together at the time against Jesus: First, the Herodians and the Sadducees, whose seditious conduct seemed to have proceeded from double motives: they hated the Nazarene and were impatient of the Roman yoke. They never forgave me for having entered the holy city with banners that bore the image of the Roman emperor; and although in this instance I had committed a fatal error, yet the sacrilege did not appear less heinous in their eyes. Another grievance also rankled in their bosoms. I had proposed to employ a part of the treasure of the temple in erecting edifices for public use. My proposal was scorned.

The Pharisees were the avowed enemies of Jesus. They cared not for the government. They bore with bitterness the severe reprimands which the Nazarene for three years had been continually giving them wherever he went. Timid and too weak to act by themselves, they had embraced the quarrels of the Herodians and the Sadducees. Besides these three parties, I had to contend against the reckless and profligate populace, always ready to join a sedition, and to profit by the disorder and confusion that resulted therefrom.

Jesus was dragged before the High Priest and condemned to death. It was then that the High Priest, Caiaphas, performed a divisory act of submission. He sent his prisoner to me to confirm his condemnation and secure his execution. I answered him that, as Jesus was a Galilean, the affair came under Herod's jurisdiction, and ordered him to be sent thither. The wily tetrarch professed humility, and, protesting his deference to the lieutenant of Caesar, he committed the fate of the man to my hands. Soon my palace assumed the aspect of a besieged citadel. Every moment increased the number of the malcontents. Jerusalem was inundated with crowds from the mountains of Nazareth. All Judea appeared to be pouring into the city.

I had taken a wife from among the Gauls, who pretended to see into futurity. Weeping and throwing herself at my feet, she said to me: "Beware, beware, and touch not that man; for he is holy. Last night I saw him in a vision. 

He was walking on the waters; he was flying on the wings of the wind. He spoke to the tempest and to the fishes of the lake; all were obedient to him. Behold, the torrent in Mount Kedron flows with blood, the statues of Caesar are filled with gemonide; the columns of the interium have given way; and the sun is veiled in mourning like a vestal in the tomb. Ah! Pilate, evil awaits thee. If thou wilt not listen to the vows of thy wife, dread the curse of a Roman Senate; dread the frowns of Caesar."

By this time the marble stair groaned under the weight of the multitude. The Nazarene was brought back to me. I proceeded to the halls of justice, followed by my guard, and asked the people in a severe tone what they demanded.

"The death of the Nazarene," was the reply.

"For what crime?"

"He has blasphemed; he has prophesied the ruin of the temple; he calls himself the Son of God, the Messiah, the King of the Jews."

"Roman justice," said I, "punishes not such offences with death."

"Crucify him! Crucify him!" cried the relentless rabble. The vociferations of the infuriated mob shook the palace to its foundations.

There was but one who appeared to be calm in the midst of the vast multitude; it was the Nazarene. After many fruitless attempts to protect him from the fury of his merciless persecutors, I adopted a measure which at the moment appeared to me to be the only one that could save his life. I proposed, as it was their custom to deliver a prisoner on such occasions, to release Jesus and let him go free, that he might be the scapegoat, as they called it; but they said Jesus must be crucified.

I then spoke to them of the inconsistency of their course as being incompatible with their laws, showing that no criminal judge could pass sentence on a criminal unless he had fasted one whole day; and that the sentence must have the consent of the Sanhedrin, and the signature of the president of that court; that no criminal could be executed on the same day his sentence was fixed, and the next day, on the day of his execution, the Sanhedrin was required to review the whole proceeding; also, according to their law, a man was stationed a short way off on horseback to cry the name of the criminal and his crime, and the names of his witnesses, and to know if any one could testify in his favor; and the prisoner on his way to execution had the right to turn back three times and to plead any new thing in his favor. I urged all these pleas, hoping they might awe them into subjection; but they still cried, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"

I then ordered Jesus to be scourged, hoping this might satisfy them; but it only increased their fury. I then called for a basin, and washed my hands in the presence of the clamorous multitude, thus testifying that in my judgment Jesus of Nazareth had done nothing deserving of death; but in vain. It was his life these wretches thirsted for.

Often in our civil commotions have I witnessed the furious anger of the multitude, but nothing could be compared to what I witnessed on this occasion. It might have been truly said that all the phantoms of the infernal regions had assembled at Jerusalem. The crowd appeared not to walk, but to be borne off and whirled as a vortex, rolling along in living waves from the portals of the praetorium even unto Mount Zion, with howling screams, shrieks, and vociferations such as were never heard in the seditions of the Pannonia, or in the tumults of the forum.

By degrees the day darkened like a winter's twilight, such as had been at the death of the great Julius Caesar. It was likewise the Ides of March. I, the continued governor of a rebellious province, was leaning against a column of my basilic, contemplating athwart the dreary gloom these fiends of Tartarus dragging to execution the innocent Nazarene. All around me was deserted. Jerusalem had vomited forth her indwellers through the funeral gate that leads to Gemonica.

An air of desolation and sadness enveloped me. My guards had joined the cavalry, and the centurion, with a display of power, was endeavoring to keep order. I was left alone, and my breaking heart admonished me that what was passing at that moment appertained rather to the history of the gods than that of men. A loud clamor was heard proceeding from Golgotha, which, borne on the winds, seemed to announce an agony such as was never heard by mortal ears. Dark clouds lowered over the pinnacle of the temple, and setting over the city covered it as with a veil. So dreadful were the signs that men saw both in the heavens and on the earth that Dionysius the Aeropagite is reported to have exclaimed, 'Either the author of nature is suffering or the universe is falling apart.'

Whilst these appalling scenes of nature were transpiring, there was a dreadful earthquake in lower Egypt, which filled everybody with fear, and scared the superstitious Jews almost to death. It is said Balthasar, an aged and learned Jew of Antioch, was found dead after the excitement was over. Whether he died from alarm or grief is not known. He was a strong friend of the Nazarene.

Near the first hour of the night, I threw my mantle around me and went down into the city toward the gates of Golgotha. The sacrifice was consummated. The crowd was returning home, still agitated, it is true, but gloomy, taciturn, and desperate. What they had witnessed had stricken them with terror and remorse. I also saw my little Roman cohort pass by mournfully, the standard-bearer having veiled his eagle in token of grief; and I overheard some of the Jewish soldiers murmuring strange words, which I did not understand. Others were recounting miracles very like those which have so often smitten the Romans by the will of the gods. Sometimes, groups of men and women would halt, then, looking back toward Mount Calvary, would remain motionless in expectation of witnessing some new prodigy.

I returned to the praetorium, sad and pensive. On ascending the stairs, the steps of which were still stained with the blood of the Nazarene, I perceived an old man in a suppliant posture, and behind him several Romans in tears. He threw himself at my feet and wept most bitterly. It is painful to see an old man weep, and my heart being already overcharged with grief, we, though strangers, wept together. And in truth it seemed that the tears lay very shallow that day with many whom I perceived in the vast concourse of people. I never witnessed such an extreme revulsion of feeling. Those who betrayed and sold him, those who testified against him, those who cried, "Crucify him, we have his blood," all slunk off like cowardly curs, and washed their teeth with vinegar. As I am told that Jesus taught a resurrection after death, if such should be the fact, I am sure it commenced in this vast crowd.

"Father," said I to him, after gaining control of my feelings, "who are you, and what is your request?"

"I am Joseph of Arimathea," replied he, "and am come to beg of you upon my knees the permission to bury Jesus of Nazareth."

"Your prayer is granted," said I to him; and at the same time I ordered Manlius to take some soldiers with him to superintend the interment, lest it should be profaned.

A few days after, the sepulchre was found empty. His disciples proclaimed all over the country that Jesus had risen from the dead, as he had foretold. This created more excitement even than the crucifixion. As to its truth, I cannot say for certain, but I have made some investigation of the matter; so you can examine for yourself, and see if I am in fault, as Herod represents.

Joseph buried Jesus in his own tomb. Whether he contemplated his resurrection or calculated to cut him another, I cannot tell. The day after he was buried [i.e., Saturday] one of the priests came to the praetorium and said they were apprehensive that his disciples intended to steal the body of Jesus and hide it, and then make it appear that he had risen from the dead, as he had foretold, and of which they were perfectly convinced. I sent him to the captain of the royal guard (Malcus) to tell him to take the Jewish soldiers, place as many around the sepulchre as were needed; then if anything should happen, they could blame themselves, and not the Romans.

When the great excitement arose about the sepulchre being found empty, I felt a deeper solicitude than ever. I sent for Malcus, who told he had placed his lieutenant, Ben Isham, with one hundred soldiers, around the sepulchre. He told me that Isham and the soldiers were very much alarmed at what had occurred there that morning. I sent for this man, Isham, who related to me, as near as I can recollect the following circumstances: He said that at about the beginning of the fourth watch they saw a soft and beautiful light over the sepulchre. He at first thought that the women had come to embalm the body of Jesus, as was their custom, but he could not see how they had gotten through the guards. While these thoughts were passing through his mind, behold, the whole place was lighted up, and there seemed to be crowds of the dead in their grave-clothes. All seemed to be shouting and filled with ecstasy, while all around and above was the most beautiful music he had ever heard; and the whole air seemed to be full of voices praising God. At this time there seemed to be a reeling and swimming of the earth, so that he turned so sick and faint that he could not stand on his feet. He said the earth seemed to swim from under him, and his senses left him, so that he knew not what did occur. I asked him in what condition he was when he came to himself. He said he was lying on the ground with his face down. I asked him if he could not have been mistaken as to the light. Was it not day that was coming in the East? He said at first he thought of that, but at a stone's cast it was exceedingly dark; and then he remembered it was too early for day.

I asked him if his dizziness might not have come from being wakened up and getting up too suddenly, as it sometimes had that effect. He said he was not, and had not been asleep all night, as the penalty was death for him to sleep on duty. He said he had let some of the soldiers sleep at a time. Some were asleep then. I asked him how long the scene lasted. He said he did not know, but he thought nearly an hour. He said it was hid by the light of day. I asked him if he went to the sepulchre after he had come to himself. He said no, because he was afraid; that just as soon as relief came, they all went to their quarters.

I asked him if he had been questioned by the priests. He said they had. They wanted him to say it was an earthquake, and that they were asleep, and offered him money to say that the disciples came and stole Jesus; but he saw no disciples; he did not know that the body was gone until he was told. I asked him what was the private opinion of those priests he had conversed with. He said that some of them thought that Jesus was no man; that he was not a human being; that he was not the son of Mary; that he was not the same that was said to be born of the virgin in Bethlehem; that the same persons had been on the earth before with Abraham and Lot, and at many times and places.

It seems to me that, if the Jewish theory be true, these conclusions are correct, for they are in accord with this man's life, as is known and testified by both friends and foes, for the elements were no more in his hands than the clay in the hands of the potter. He could convert water into wine; he could change death into life, disease into health; he could calm the seas, still the storms, call up fish with a silver coin in its mouth. Now, I say, if he could do all these things, which he did, and many more, as the Jews all testify, and it was doing these things that created this enmity against him--he was not charged with criminal offenses, nor was he charged with violating any law, nor of wronging any individual in person, and all these facts are known to thousands, as well by his foes as by his enemies--I am almost ready to say, as did Manilus at the cross, "Truly, this was the Son of God."

Now, noble Sovereign, this is as near the facts in the case as I can arrive at, and I have taken pains to make the statement very full, so that you may judge of my conduct upon the whole, as I hear that Antipater has said many hard things of me in this matter. With the promise of faithfulness and good wishes to my noble Sovereign,

I
 am your most obedient servant,

Atiku and packaging sha

The man is just totally lacking in charisma, he just fails to inspire😪

Watching him is so boring despite the fact that he was making some sense

8/23/22, 10:09 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Ro his mantra of unifying the country leaves more questions than answers.

He is called the 'unifier'. This man cannot put his party in order and wants to unify Nigeria. There are a million wikes in Nigeria who needs a leader with supersonic emotional intelligence to guide and get results.

Between Obi and Atiku. Obi should be more offended than Atiku, because Wike Unilaterally undermined Obi in the PDP and what did Obi do? He paid him a courtesy visit after joining the LP. Not once, not twice.

How has Atiku managed Wike?. He will eventually call his bluff.

So for me, the true unifier is someone who will come down from his high horse and relate on the same frequency as the 'wikes' to achieve results.

You cannot unify the country when you can't unify your party. 


You cannot preach unity when you have had unsteady relationships.( Atiku has married from every tribe to prove his is true Nigerian and should be in the position to lead. But are these women happy?).

Obi has a superior emotional intelligence to really unify this country.

You need to stoop to conquer in a heterogeneous mix like ours where egos must be massaged, voices must be heard, justice must be served and everyone treated as equals.

Atiku is not that leader. His antecedents rules him out.
8/23/22, 10:13 AM - +234 810 006 7926: How do you give every part of the country a sense of belonging when you are contesting from the North after another Northerner Fulani Muslim  ruled for 8 years.
8/23/22, 10:15 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Does his speech inspire Hope?

PO spoke and you can see hope
8/23/22, 10:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: His correctly recognizes our lack of unity but his solution is stupid

He said they achieved unity in 1999 by incorporating ever geopolitical zone in key government positions. 

Nigga be preaching QUOTA system...another reason why this country's progress is stifled

So you take one person from my geopolitical, zone and make them senate president and that would assuage my grouse? 

That's very rich coming from a man that scuttled zoning because he wants power. Such a hypocrite 

If you want to unite this country, just prosper it. Nothing is as unifying as shared success
8/23/22, 10:17 AM - +234 806 566 2895: He tried so hard to speak with passion that he obviously lacks

Peter Obi has really made them all step up
8/23/22, 10:18 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True.

He stood for the first few minutes of his speech to prove he is fit and later sat down
8/23/22, 10:18 AM - +234 810 006 7926: PO has upped the ante in all aspects
8/23/22, 10:20 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Not really

Is Fulani the only tribe in Nigeria?

If Atiku wants to be honest and sellable, he knows nothing about unity and should not expect much in his favour in 2023 by Gods Grace

Judge: "How?" 

The terrorist replied: "I can't read or write!" 

Hate never spreads through knowledge. It always spreads through ignorance. This is how societies pay the price of ignorance. 

Ignorance is the reason we hate others based on what we heard about them  not what we know. 

Please don't hate anyone because of what they told you about him or her. 

Remember someone's enemy can be your helper tomorrow.

Have a glorious day.

This woman has summarized it All.

Unlike the rhetoric canvassed by politicians, this election will be a two horse race between:

 *the Establishment* and the *New order.* 

The establishment typified by the hitherto PDP and the current APC and the new Order highlighted by LP( not taking anything away from the SDP, NNPP, ADC etc ).

Why the new Order is key to our survival.

In 23 years of the establishment, Nigeria has never been so insecure( Needless deaths, Rape, Kidnapping), Indebted( we can't service our debts as we borrow to pay debts and meet our budget deficit). The Naira( our pride), the weakest and might hit 1,000 Naira to a pound. 

Our oil is stolen and we produce enough can't meet our OPEC cut and spend billions to fix refinaries that hasn't worked in 23 years. 
Billions are paid to Tompolo to secure national assets. Major oil producers have left in droves. For a first, more money has come from Nigerians living abroad than the total money Nigeria made from exporting oil and other goods( *Close to 40 billion USD from diaspora remittances compared to over 30 billion USD Nigeria made from exports)* 

Cost of living has increased. Years ago 3k  can cook a healthy pot of Jollof rice for a family of 5-6. Now it costs over 6k to make the same pot( jollof rice index), now families can't even eat jollof. The average hours of power to homes have decreased from 4-6 hours to as low as days of no public power supply.

Health indices( MMR, IMR, Average life expectancy, access to health, Health tourism, with billions spent by Nigerians to India etc, Massive brain drain( worst since the civil war).

The only thing that has brought joy or giving us a sense of pride as Nigerians are the youth.

Nigerian youths have set up world class companies valued at over 1 billion USD( flutterwave et al),

Nigerian youths have sold music, stories, fashion, art, food and movies to rake in billions of dollars.

The youths has brought laurels to give you a sense of pride when you watch them fight, run, play.( Even when they loose now, you still have that sense of pride).

Nigerian youths are breaking every records in universities across the globe even in countries that don't speak English or their mother tongue.


If there is anything positive left of the damage the establishment has made, to Nigeria, you can link it to the Nigerian youths who have made their mark in aerospace, technology, artificial intelligence and robotics etc).


 _The new order and the youths_ 

The youths have taken their destinies in their own hands and have decided to retire the very politicians who have always stood on their oxygen tube for survival.

Nigerian youths both home and abroad have decided to be Obidient and Yusful .

If the youths can achieve so much in a country on life support, what will happen if they are discharged and free to fulfill their full potentials.


The LP is that vehicle to ventilate their frustrations. It is the only party with Humans at the epicenter of a wheel that typifies and industrial revolution. The establishment has had inanimate objects ( *umbrella* ( beaten serially by rain and now hail stones), *broom* rather than a vacuum cleaner in a 21st century, cocks, basket of fruits etc.

The family is the fulcrum of the new renaissance. If Nigeria gets it right with our families, we will get it right with the society and country).
A situation where father's can't provide for their children, wives, parents and extended families and have left their children sell their bodies for money, use their laptops for yahoo has eaten deep into the fabrics of our culture. The father who couldn't provide for the kids may not be able to even question the source of wealth of his children. 


It will take a  revolution or simply put a movement to ensure a new way of life that is viable for generations to come.

Ogun, Ibadan, Auchi, PH, Benin have spoken and others will follow.

By Gods Grace we would come to that promise Land come Feb 2023

9/4/22, 4:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: He told me he told Peter Obi to be careful and that if the powers that be wanted to still frustrate him it would be very easy.

9/4/22, 4:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Your goal should be appointments for now. If it clicks take a leave and show results. At that point you can begin to consider running for electoral positions.

I was glad to see the clap back, no more pacifist approach

See that old man, you'd pass him on the street and assume he's an illiterate, but you'd be very very wrong. See how clear his ideas and demands were?

This election will shock everyone
9/5/22, 5:13 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It will be political suicide for the establishment in Pdp and APC to take for granted the frustrations of Nigerians who have chosen the LP and Obidatti to vent their anger.
9/5/22, 5:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You're quite right

I'm sure they'll work hard to prevent PVC of late registrants from emerging.

Sadly, even that may not work

Peter Obi's support base in unshakeable and if that were all it would be understandable. 

But he's eating into APC & PDP strongholds quite aggressively

I remember vividly the Last time this happened was in 1996. In Rayfield Jos, after Nigeria came back from behind to beat Brazil in the semifinals of Men's soccer, taxi men gave free rides to passengers. They felt like a Nigerian with Nationhood at the fore front.

The mother backing her child in the forefront of the protest in Ibadan was the most touching for me.


Rowland you couldn't have put it better.

How can we do BBC Hausa interviews?

Still feel we need more inroads into the NW.

Datti would need all the support he needs.


Physical *collection, possession and retention* ( without selling ones PVC ) for us now is key
9/5/22, 5:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The BBC Hausa interviews are in the pipeline, once Sept 28th arrives it'll begin

The NW NE campaigns are in full swing, I can give you the Twitter handle of some guys in Katsina, Zamfara, Kano and Yobe making huge strides. There you can follow their activities

When I see the kind of support Obi has generated, the things his campaign has made people do, I think how wicked the opposition are, that something people so desperately want, like water in the desert and you can still try to deny them that, for selfish ambition.

It's extremely painful, it's like a dying man begging for a meal and you smash it under your foot

IT'S THE VERY BASE OF HUMANITY

The number of persons spending their money in this economy just to see a better country through Peter Obi, but one man who can want for nothing in this life still wants to snatch that away from them?

Kai!

Insight to how oil 🛢️ has been stolen by those entrusted in it's care.

Take a peep!
9/6/22, 2:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Buhari is the main crook
9/6/22, 2:25 PM - +234 817 034 1232: He is the one supervising the oil theft
9/6/22, 2:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: My God!. I don't think the oil industry has ever been so corrupt.
 
Nigerians can't be paid salaries from proceeds from oil, because trillions are spent on subsidizing fuel for Niger and Chad.

I question why there is so much of our money going to Niger. Are we making these countries a bee-hive for terrorists to thrive and always lunch attacks from?.

If you really spend this money on the declining lake Chad , it makes sense.

19 billion USD proceeds from the Port of Philadelphia from oil originating from Nigeria unaccounted by the state for me is crass incompetence 

Paying Tompolo 64 billion Naira to guard National assets is a self indictment on Buhari who calls himself a RTD general.
9/6/22, 3:01 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The money is going to Niger because of Buhari's maternal roots and since he is a terrorist he will naturally allow the terrorists at the border to crossover into Nigeria and wreck havoc.

If you are looking for the 19 billion dollars....there is a List of those involved in the theft about 20 of them with Buhari in charge of the stealing
9/6/22, 3:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: NNPC officials

18. Salihu Jamari (MD Nigeria Gas and Power Investment Company Limited)

19. Mohammed Zango (MD NNPC Medical Services)

20. Sarki Auwalu (Director, Department of Petroleum Resources)
9/6/22, 3:14 PM - +234 817 034 1232: These are the people responsible for oil theft.

Buhari is the chief in charge.

The amount giving to Tompolo is peanuts compared to what is happening 


Angola an oil producing country in  has taken advantage of Russian Ukrainian war to pay it's debt 

But Nigeria entered into more debt with sky high oil prices

The chief of Naval staff made some revelations last week but he was still economical with the truth 

The Chief of Naval staff revealed alot in his interview with Channels TV.
He came short of telling Nigerians that the oil theft we are being told is carried out in the Niger delta is actually carried out in the offices of NNPC and NLNG.

How can massive ships load crude at designated points without the requisite documentation?
When they are caught by the Navy,that is when their documentation is forwarded to the Navy for them to be released?
The question is,what would have happened if they were not caught?

He gave another example of a ship measuring 336m in length,60metres in width which was also caught loading on official platforms without the requisite documentation.



He also said that there is no way oil theft from pipelines will be upto 20,000 barrels of crude oil., saying that 10,000 barrels of crude oil is around 15,800,000 litres of crude and that it will take a 5 ton barge to make 3160 trips per day to convey such to the high sea and this can never be done without being noticed.
9/6/22, 3:44 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Damning revelation.

What we produce must be *metered* and not *estimated* by JVC.

Honestly we need a PO/Datti to cut this waste and cost of governance.

By now we should be divesting from oil as a dwindling resource. We should produce and manufacture items for export, while proceeds from oil should be saved or at most spent on capital projects to bridge the gap.

Every local government must be seen and run as an economic zones for exports rather than the current default.

Taxes can be channelled to pay salaries and fund Health and run recurrent expenditures of wards, councils and states.


We must change the way of doing things.

If Angola used the war in Ukr to their adv.

9/6/22, 3:59 PM - +234 817 034 1232: @2348100067926 this is how Saudi Arabia monitors its pipeline 

No need for Tompolo or Nigerian Navy

Buhari is just a crook 

They know the right thing to do 

Nigerians instead of seeking out information will be doing tribal and religious politics 

That is why their leaders exploit them
9/6/22, 4:00 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Any serious country 

This is how pipelibe and shipping of oil is done
9/6/22, 4:01 PM - +234 803 979 5623: Happy birthday Drs Luka and Newton!!!
9/6/22, 4:07 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Wow. This is the way to go. 
NNPC claims they want to be like ARAMCO.

Nigerians must own NNPC as shares. That is the only way it can be efficient.

The Northern and Religious conflagration and hegemony has to stop.
9/6/22, 5:20 PM - +234 803 470 6347: Happy birthday Newton and Luka. May the Lord bless you and the work of your hand.

9/6/22, 11:53 PM - Paul Ashir: HBD Newton and Datong.
9/7/22, 12:20 AM - +234 703 714 8734: My first case in Orthopedics Surgery during HJ was a man who had been kidnapped from his house and released on the road, Abuja-Kd highway, after 3days... A good Samaritan brought him to the hospital.

When we were called to review, my Reg and I went, and behold, he was lying down...no sound. 

1. One of his eyeballs was punctured and the vitreous and aqueous humors squeezed out, so it was mostly the sclera that was left. 

2. The other eye was scooped out leaving and empty gaping eye socket. 

3. His mandible (jawbone) was broken in the midline

4. They had cut his tongue..

5. They broke his arms.

Now, on seeing him, terror gripped us; for we wondered, trying the fathom the level of wickedness that the perpetrators had in their hearts to carry out such evil. I was soo broken, I couldn't eat till night. I couldn't even pretend or remain professional... I was broken. 

This is the ordeal of the average Nigerian in different forms. The insecurity, the carnage, the impunity... The pure evil and hate... This system cannot continue. 

If any healthcare worker opens their mouth to tell of what they see daily (not to talk of the ones that never make it to the hospital), you'd feel sick.

See, there is enough evil to go round if we choose to stand aloof. 2023 is a matter of life and death... We cannot afford another failed leadership. We dare not tolerate it... It costs lives! 

Our lenses of sentiments worn when we pick our leaders costs lives! 

Pull these lenses... Put the sentiments aside. Look at the candidates beyond your individual stomach infrastructure... 

#VoteObiDatti... At least, with men of fair integrity (at the very least), we have a chance of turning this train from the path of doom. The evil and the bloodshed is way too much to take chances.

Why this election is different.

Before now if the card reader didn't recognize your finger print you can use the incident form to vote( This was a vent for mass rigging in 2015 and 2019 as someone can buy your voters card and use to vote, and so many underage voting.)


Now if the card reader( Now BVAS ) does not recognize your finger print (95%accuracy), facial recognition with your cornea is employed. If the two fails, by Law you cannot vote, thus putting to rest the use of incidence form.

Secondly, before now you would have to go home after accreditation to come back and vote, thus people hated coming out to vote because of the waste in time, thus they would rather use the day of elections to rest, play on the street or travel out the day before for business. Now you vote immediately you have been accredited, thus cutting the time spent on the queue to vote. This will encourage more people to come out to vote, as what took a whole day to conclude could be wrapped up before 11 a.m.

Thirdly, and most importantly, At the end of the elections, the result will be counted, acknowledged by party agents present and entered directly to the INEC cloud portal( which is accessible to All Nigerians anywhere in the world).
 Before now after manual collation, the results are sent to the collation centers( where a lot of manipulations were done), ballots where snatched on their way to collation centers and replaced with thumb printed ballots. And the results where altered( 10,000 became 510,000 because figure 5 was added to 10,000).

The total no of registered voters will still be shred to have an almost fool proof voters register( not sure but if I remember,it would be accessible online as well).

Truth be told APC, PDP are actually scared of INEC. Buhari is not seeking election and his body language has given the INEC chair and his team to do the right thing.
90 %of the governor's, senators and house of representatives are not coming back and hence gives INEC a little room to do the right thing.

My only worry is that Govs have tried to send names of new REC members to replace some that just retired and I doubt if the Senate will approve. Remember Onochie was a card carrying member of the APC and she was rejected by the House after the public outcry

Mahdi Shehu hmmm.

I honestly think Nigerians have suffered enough to know the right thing to do  without been told or reminded.

Politicians have always told you how you should think, what you should do and not do. It is time to turn the tables and tell the politicians, activists what they should do and not do and how they should think.

It should be the other way round. The people sitting and listening to Mahdi Shehu should be the ones telling him what to do and go how to go about it.

However, my concern is that most newly registered voters are people that are just trying to believe their votes will count this time around, and if a chunk of them are disenfranchised, then there's a concern.

Who recalls Kabiru Sokoto the master mind of the Catholic church bombing in the outskirts of Abuja?.  This guy was found in the govt lodge while Shettima was governor of Borno.
9/14/22, 6:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Can Atiku be trusted? A picture speaks a thousand words!.

A man who broke his party's constitution that preached rotation of the president and rushed to pick his form wants to contest as president to defend the constitution of the FRN. 

If you breeched a simple party constitution, how can Nigerians trust you to defend them based on requirements of the constitution.

If you could delete a tweet you made to condemn Samuel Deborah's killing because of Islamic fanatics who came after you, what heart and character do you have to prove you will defend the interests of Nigerians and not your religion.


You preach Unity and all the PDP positions are zoned to the north. Turning a once national party to a regional party and he makes every effort to make PO look like a regional president.


Atiku has no experience for anything good. Where is Nitel today that he privatized?. Is Nepa better then than PHCN now?. What happened to our ports?
9/14/22, 6:31 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Atiku can't be trusted 
He will not solve insecurity 

With this picture...it is obvious how the security of the country will be as well as the deleted tweet
9/14/22, 6:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If we must be honest PO and Datti are the only team that can bring us out of the woods. The fear of the north that the east will break away like the civil war is not tenable. No body will be president and see the country he presides breakaway. Our issues are deep and metastasing, only one who has the interest of the country at Heart will be out next president by Gods Grace.

Atiku was VP for 8 years, how many universities did use his position to influence that was built in the north( yet he built a private University after he left office.Now compare this with Datti who owns a private university before he becomes Vice President).

How many companies/factories where built or by foreign direct investment ( FDI) came to the north.


Buhari contested severally and when he eventually won, he wasn't prepared for the office and will go down as one of the worst presidents we ever had and we will never have again.

Now Atiku has been contesting since 1992. Are we like Buhari going to entrust him and he will come there overwhelmed and giving excuses to solve a problem he was a part of from 1999?
9/14/22, 6:44 PM - +234 806 566 2895: He keeps using his private university to brag

That university is older than Convenant university, but please check ranking of universities and tell me where his university is

It is nowhere any of the top private universities, let alone all the universities

The key principle underpinning all Atiku's economic policies is PRIVATIZATION. He has not successfully privatized anything, all he's privitized from NITEL to PHCN, all failures. 

Just an opportunity to LOOT

He knows how to reel out policies that sound melodious to the ear but lack any concrete foundation
9/14/22, 6:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Besides his seeming lack of integrity, selfish interest and now possible BH ties

Let him just park one side, we don't have his time before Emilokan was adjudged to be a more serious threat
9/14/22, 6:45 PM - +234 810 006 7926: As VP ASUU went on more strikes, so what is he coming to do differently now we are indebt?

You say you will pool 10 billion USD for the private sector. How are you going to get it? Are you going to borrow?.

No foreigner will want to invest in Nigeria now. However our silver lining rests with Nigerians living abroad who will be the first to invest in their country when things improve.
9/14/22, 6:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The two parties have tried to make it look it's a fight between the two forgetting APC existed to foister Buhari and has since expired.

LP is the new order, and this election is between Nigerians and the establishment
9/14/22, 6:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Don't mind him, he thinks we are learners

Obi said he will change banking policies and loan structure to allow more loans to go to SME instead of the 1% that's really wealthy and never repay their loans

You can see the source of funds to inject into the economy

Atiku wants to pump 10B USD from him ass😒

9/15/22, 9:58 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Highly remarkable
9/15/22, 10:04 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Vic these things can be done. It's just the right leadership and the political will to build, maintain and sustain these facilities. The Indian embassy is Lagos is the second most patronised embassy after the US not because Nigerians want to Japa or travel for pleasure, but because they need to go do surgeries and procedures, making medical tourism a new venture for capital flight.
9/15/22, 10:09 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You can imagine that
9/15/22, 10:11 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Well, the fear of a total economic collapse is making the senate realize late that they need to do things right and adopt the orosanye reports. 

What we have had all along is managers and not leaders. And they still managed poorly
9/15/22, 10:11 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: How do you explain an agency of Govt spending 7billion and generating only 7m in a whole yea

9/15/22, 10:33 AM - +234 806 566 2895: We debated this on another group

While this is laudable, you have to question the opportunity cost

What proportion of the population have cardiovascular diseases that cannot be managed in the usual hospitals, that require a specialized center like this? I wager a rather small proportion 

Would the larger proportion of the population not be better served by channeling the funds to lower tier centers like general hospitals and PHC?

Because there is a relatively small proportion of the population that need such specialized services and the entire population might be better served by improving services that cater to the larger, poorer population

Another question is, what proportion of the population would be able to afford the services offered in this center? The chances are the cost for diagnosis and management may be pricier than in the usual health facilities. This means a significant proportion of those who need the services might be economically priced out. Those who can afford the services may prefer treatment abroad

I guess I'm just saying, we need to critically analyze how we use scarce resources, even though Rivers State is one of the wealthier states
9/15/22, 10:48 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The points you have raised are valid. And while I do not counter them, for lack of more detailed information on the integrated decision making process that resulted in this outcome, I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt
9/15/22, 10:48 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I want to believe that all of the cost benefit analysis and cost effectiveness analysis and such likes were duly considered.
9/15/22, 10:49 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Every time a resource scarce or not is spent, there is an alternative cost. In a country like Nigeria where a visionary move like this is an august visitor, I think we can give credit to Wike.
9/15/22, 10:50 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: His jurisdiction is his state and if I recall several years back discussions with One or two people in Rivers, some attention is being paid to the primary healthcare system.
9/15/22, 10:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Fair enough

But I have some of the background information you alluded to, as I worked in the Primary health care management board in Rivers State for two years
9/15/22, 10:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: That aside, you referenced the population that will access this service.  I do not think that Wike has limited his vision to clientele within Nigeria alone
9/15/22, 10:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: No sir

This did not and never does happen in Naija 😂😂😂
9/15/22, 10:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This center can be a hub for west Africa and even Africa.

9/15/22, 10:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree Rivers State is doing very well at PHC level but there are other needs
9/15/22, 10:53 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Remember that 2 major things drive the demand for foreign exchange in Nigeria - Educational tourism and health tourism
9/15/22, 10:53 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Thus putting pressure on our currency
9/15/22, 10:53 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The beneficial effects are ripple actually
9/15/22, 10:54 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Hmmm

Here's my point. Such decisions are rarely evidenced driven or based on data such as prevalence of CVD that aren't capable of being managed at a tertiary healthcare center

It rarely happens Victor

Such decisions are often driven by politicians and not health experts
9/15/22, 10:54 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If he can even divert a percentage of that flow to India to Rivers, it’s a win for the sustainability of the system, the training facilities for more specialized care lacking across the country etc etc
9/15/22, 10:54 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very good point
9/15/22, 10:55 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There are states in the US for example Massachusetts whose major revenue comes from health tourism
9/15/22, 10:56 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: With Boston General hospital massive structure
9/15/22, 10:56 AM - +234 806 566 2895: This is theory Victor

The stress on our currency isn't these two factors in practice. The effects of these two things given others is not as significant 

It is large driven by politicians hoarding it and choosing to spend it rather than naira
9/15/22, 10:56 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Brighams Womens hospital driving mad Research across the world etc

9/15/22, 10:57 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Over the last 2-3 years they have become major Sir
9/15/22, 10:57 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: With the thousands of people relocating or going to school. Demand for dollar rises, false scarcity is created and naira plummets
9/15/22, 10:57 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's true but you must remember that such centers were built first on expertise before infrastructure

Confidence in the quality of our services is quite low. After all it's still the same health workers that will offer services here
9/15/22, 10:58 AM - +234 806 566 2895: We can agree to disagree
9/15/22, 10:58 AM - +234 806 566 2895: And I'm saying that despite this, what politicians do with dollar in a day trumps tens to hundreds of students
9/15/22, 10:59 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: No doubt other factors play a role especially during an electioneering period
9/15/22, 11:00 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You're getting there😂
9/15/22, 11:02 AM - +234 806 566 2895: But I understand your point and it's valid

I just know for a fact that when you start quizzing the data driving such projects, you'd find them lacking

For instance, what diseases are most prevalent in the state, CVD, renal diseases, emerging diseases, haemorrhagic fevers?

Do they need specialized services or you may be better served by improving existing centers?
9/15/22, 11:05 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Many existing centers can be refurbished and improved rather than building new facilities

Truth be told, all these specialized treatment centers can be in tertiary health centers. I personally think it's more efficient and the integration is better.

People with such advanced disease will have comorbid conditions. Will they all be offered in this center or will they have to shuttle between several centers?
9/15/22, 11:05 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I generally think it's best to improve existing facilities than erect new ones

It's even more cost effective
9/15/22, 11:06 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: With a paradigm change in society, the risk factors for NCDs have become prevalent with increasing numbers of cases. I also know that for those who can afford these specialized services, often it’s not there and where it is there, mostly non functional or reliable
9/15/22, 11:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: What I really would love to see happen is how it’s managed. I believe that we should begin to leverage Franchises in Nigerias health space
9/15/22, 11:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: For instance I would like to see an EHA clinics at the helm of affairs of this Hospital
9/15/22, 11:08 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree 
We have the double and triple burden of diseases but we still have an overwhelming number of infectious diseases

There isn't a center for management and research of emerging infectious diseases BTW
9/15/22, 11:08 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Our health systems were initially designed as goodwill centres ab initio which was difficult to manage as resources poured into it could not be matched by revenue generated to ensure sustainability.
9/15/22, 11:08 AM - +234 806 566 2895: If the motive for it's establishment is flawed, it will become as bad as existing centers

This is part of my point
9/15/22, 11:08 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Todays healthcare systems are designed as business entities because they provide services
9/15/22, 11:09 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: As we battle to see states become self sustaining financially.

1% of Rivers State population over the age of 40 years.

Including the entire country's population isn't helpful as the population often dependent on this is often local
9/15/22, 11:52 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I actually responded to this. You raised valid points, but you will be shocked these people who you say can't afford these procedures raise monies to queue in the Indian embassy to have it done outside.


Public Specialist centers( cheaper than their private competitors) that I know of in Nigeria is not up to 10. I know a cancer center is proposed in Abuja but even that is not enough to serve the whole country and neighboring West African countries

9/15/22, 12:02 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Nigerians spent close to 11 billion USD in over 10 years on health tourism and average about 1.5 billion annually.

Imagine if this was retained in our economy and the spiral effect on the economy
9/15/22, 12:03 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This rest on assuming that people have confidence in our centers

9/15/22, 12:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: A case in point is Ondo state during gov Mimiko. He built from scratch specialist hospitals ( Mother and Child Hospitals in Akure and Ondo) for Obs neonatology and paeds( age 1-5). And it was so effective that it dropped MMR in Ondo and we had patients coming from Benin, Togo, Okada, Benin, Kano etc. 

Now he built a world class trauma center ( which at the time was the best in the country. In fact at the time.

Then was Kidney care center with prospects for renal transplants and dialysis.



Each where run by their CMDS and did not put them under the hospital management board.

Is like National hospital Abuja( was it better under the presidency or under the ministry of health as it is today?)

When these facilities were merged to form the teaching hospital for the specialized university for Medicine ( UNIMEDTHC), 

Things never were as optimal as the individual centers.

So it may not be entirely true that when you refurbish or build them within tertiary centers there will be run better.

Even now Specialist university as coming up( case in point University of Medical Sciences Ondo) and Medical cities are been built round the world with mainly specialist referral centers and a little of the jack of all trades teaching hospitals 


When they
9/15/22, 12:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Lol Abiola you're making my point

MCH services are in heavy demand by almost 70% of the population. Women of reproductive age and children

Just read my posts again you'll understand my point.

You points aren't without merit, my criticism is there are more effective ways to spend such funds. *This is the argument, nothing else*
9/15/22, 12:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: What you don't see is that you can't take the money you where to use to build specialist centers and say we should rather spend it on primary or sec centers .

The 3 are exclusive and should All be taken seriously with attendant monies allocated.

I don't like the idea of saying oo that money that was used to build this should have been spent on building that, when in actual fact there are exclusive of each other.

Monies for PHC ( they have their own management boards and engage NGOs) should be spent on PHCs. Monies spent on SHC should be likewise

9/15/22, 12:28 PM - +234 806 566 2895: If you did the MCH facilities by Mimiko isn't a good analogy
9/15/22, 12:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It's a state project

I don't know how deeply you understand economic evaluation in health economics. (I'm not trying to be patronizing)

The reason I asked is that, the concept assumes that funds are not unlimited and everything comes at opportunity cost of something else being lost.

Consequently, a good health manager uses clinical and demographics of the population to decide on the best interventions, you essentially look out for what meets the needs of the majority when you have limited funds.

Anyways I think I'm repeating myself and we seem not to understand each other so I'll stop here
9/15/22, 12:34 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's was made to highlight the fact that the so called tertiary institutions don't have to be refurbished to accommodate the so called ' specialist' centers to be more efficient.

The specialist centers can stand alone and be better run an efficient and I made the case of the spread it made to patients we saw from Togo, Republic of Benin 

Mind you MCH was not a PHC, it was a specialist tertiary center
9/15/22, 12:38 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Case in point Ondo state had one of the highest MMR and Infant Mortality rates and that was what informed the building of MCH and the best referral system yet in the country from TBAs, PHCs.


That some of these projects are not done with a cost analysis or opportunity cost might as alluded in your earlier submissions may not be entirely true. At least the case in point, I presented proves to the contrary

9/19/22, 9:02 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Rowland the thing I learnt from this guy today was the fact that you owe allegiance first to yourself, then to Nigeria, before your political party.

2023 election for the APC is about not going into exriction and winning to stay in power after 7 years and not for the battle of the soul of Nigeria.


For the PDP is about coming back to power after been in the sidelines for 7 years( people are already sharing posts before campaigns start, case in point Tambuwal who wants to be made senate president). 

For BAT and Atiku, is about personal ambition and not about bringing us out of the ICU and life support.

I love his courage to remain in the PDP and vote for the personality of Peter Obi.

Of a truth, the 2023 elections is not about the parties or their septuagenarian candidates with selfish personal interests to use power to build a political and business empire at the expense of  Nigeria.


I like the fact that his brought my attention to the fact that any election should be about the individuals and any party where they find themselves, they should be voted.

Until we get to this point we won't cross the threshold or rate limiting step of our nascent democracy ( a 23 year old  should be matured enough to be his own man)
9/19/22, 9:13 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree completely

I loved the way he said, his conscience first, Nigeria next and then party. I tell you this, Nigerians will long remember him and when it matters vote him

You see all these ones clamoring for power despite and obvious lack of capacity are either simply unaware of how bad the rot is, or simply don't care.

It's like being single and intent on marrying and the only choice you have is a sex worker. Most people will rather stay single. Either you're unaware what marriage to a sex worker means, you just want to get married or you truly know you can cope. 
That's where naija is right now and you can tell which leader fits into which category.

Political parties are like a cult, thar ostracize you for supporting anyone outside your party like it's a taboo and your chances are married for life. Only hopeless people who live by sight and can't dare to believe will comply to such a weak thought process

How often are our predictions about the future correct that you see a good choice at this moment but choose a bad one because you're afraid for your future? 😓

Also the purported names included in the INEC register is IMO is Tinubu's ploy to rubbish BVAS and the whole process, then take INEC to court and get an injunction restraining INEC from using BVAS.

I think he has some judges in his pocket.

9/22/22, 2:47 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Excerpts:

Ebrahim Raisi, lacking any formal education or legal experience, became a revolutionary “judge” in the aftermath of Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, and immediately rose through the political ranks. To some analysts, this is a sign of his “shrewd opportunism.” To Iranians, Raisi’s ascension, the one blithely compared in leading international outlets to that of an indefatigable corporate tycoon, is soaked in the blood of their loved ones.

As a young revolutionary judge, Raisi’s early career bore more resemblance to a zealous Al-Qaeda operative than a rising politician. To the tens of thousands of Iranians who continue to bear the brunt of his crimes, Ebrahim Raisi is a terrorist. His leadership of the Islamic Republic’s death commissions, which featured seconds-long kangaroo courts leading to mass executions of political dissidents, has been recognized by Amnesty International and other leading human rights institutions as an ongoing crime against humanity. It is ongoing because Raisi, with a zeal perhaps not seen again until the formation of the Islamic State, had his victims tortured and buried in mass, unmarked graves. To this day, many families are unaware of the location of the bodies of their loved ones.

9/26/22, 9:11 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Valid point! Apologies for trying to fragment the group! 🙏🙏🙏

We can pick a few locations for the reunion. Based on geographical proximity, titans can connect for the Reunion in different locations possibly on the same day.

Locations could include Jos, Abuja, Lagos, .........

I am not sure it's feasible for everyone to be in one location for the reunion. My personal thought though. Others may share different opinions about the location for the reunion! 🙏
9/26/22, 9:13 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Thank you everyone. I honestly appreciate the show of love, camaraderie and support. God bless you all.

9/26/22, 3:58 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Obi isn't the one leading those rallies. These rallies are spontaneous expressions of the frustration that those involved have about current Nigeria.  I agree that those in the corridors of power don't share these frustrations of a Nigeria that isn't working, as  I don't expect a chef to say what he cooked isn't tasty, but with some discernment,we should understand that we,the people,have had enough. # just passing too

Garri no need advert or commercials
9/26/22, 4:02 PM - +234 817 034 1232: But this has been done in the SE

Without Peter Obi

Let's urge Tinubu to do so first😃
9/26/22, 4:02 PM - +234 803 692 8469: I know those are his lovers cum supporters. 
I am only asking that he leads that of the S/E by carrying the Nigeria flag.

May Nigeria succeed by brother.
9/26/22, 4:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Why not Tinubu?
9/26/22, 4:03 PM - +234 803 692 8469: Okay….


But I want Obi to simply carry Nigeria (zoo) flag and lead a rally in S/E na.
9/26/22, 4:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: He will campaign in the SE once the campaign starts which is September 28 

And  Nigeria doesn't even deserve to be called a zoo....zoo is more organised sef

Nigeria is a Jungle

If it's possible to separate peacefully we support that pathway 

But since we are together for now Peter is better than Atiku as well as Tinubu 😁
9/26/22, 4:06 PM - +234 803 692 8469: Guys how about this video na….
9/26/22, 4:07 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Those men in the video are separatist and have lost hope in Nigeria. Obi has not and neither have I. But,suffice to say that the separatists gain alot of momentum and gathered more sympathisers due to the unmarketable performance of this current government. It will take alot to win them over,especially as the poor performance of buhari has allowed proliferation of arms in a scale never before seen in Nigeria..but,it can be done.
9/26/22, 4:08 PM - +234 803 281 3842: When campaigns begin officially, your desire would come to pass.
9/26/22, 4:10 PM - +234 817 034 1232: About this video

It is politically orchestrated.

How comes the separatists are not attacking APC and PDP meetings in the southeast only labour party meeting 


Well its even possible that APC led by Tinubu and Yahaya Bello are leading this  narrative. You know they have past history of associating with thugs 

Who knows 🤷🏽‍♂️ maybe white lion and Jagaban are working behind the scenes to orchestrate this

Possibly it's pdp...but it is more likely to be handiwork of APC😊
9/26/22, 4:10 PM - +234 803 692 8469: These so called separatists exist in a state with executive governors who have fundamental and political powers yet the S/E is where they are today.
Let’s start with these governors before heading for the Mr President.

We will do it for him

But we have been doing it abi you no dey online? 😜
9/26/22, 4:12 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Well if you say Peter Obi cannot campaign in East because of separatists

Then it is an indictment on the leaders of APC... it shows they can't handle security 

This includes Buhari Tinubu Yahaya....goes to show they are incompetent in security 

This is why Peter is beter😃
9/26/22, 4:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

Something: the love of the *entire* south eastern brethren from him
9/26/22, 4:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: For everyone 500M Tinubu walks without assistance I'll give you 100k Adams you can donate to any white lion or white elephant project of your choosing
9/26/22, 4:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: If you're still struggling to see that's no one's fault

The truth is the regions that will shock you guys are where you feel most safe and where you think you don't need to rig

These regions LP will poach

If una like share money to inspire cultists and criminals to incite violence, on that day people will vote and una eye go clear😃

Somehow Obi is different. I think some of us can be different
9/26/22, 4:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think this IPOB colouration should stop if you ask me. It's just like saying Atiku is a ' killer heard Man because he is Fulani'.
9/26/22, 4:53 PM - +234 803 692 8469: I am not an elite but a common Nigerian.

We are all praying for a better Nigeria.
Nigeria shall be great again.
9/26/22, 4:55 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Let's go on this bet👌🏼🙏🏽
9/26/22, 4:55 PM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother you've said it

I'm surprised the same doesn't apply to Atiku

It's a shame it's rearing it's ugly head here

There are more Igbos who are anti-IPOB than those for it, simply because they realize that if they separate and still got people like Ikpeazu, Uzodinma they're doomed

They're tired of this marriage of inconvenience

I daresay there more separatists and IPOB right now in middle belt and North than in Igboland
9/26/22, 4:56 PM - +234 803 692 8469: Oya e don do for now.

9/28/22, 3:13 PM - +234 810 006 7926: *What you must know about Candidates of PO, Atiku and BAT*

In 2023, Nigeria will be looked at as  a 36 storey building, that has foundational issues and may collapse any day. 

If the three candidates were engineers, *who would you pick to fix the problem?* 

Let's profile them to help arrive at an informed decision before you sign that contract to fix the building ( 'Nigeria')


 *BAT*

 *Is he going to fix the problem?* 

Well, he would paint the building, put LED lights and make the building look like new without fixing the foundational problem. It will be so fine, people will go to take photos for their Instagram and his antecedent say so
( As governor he resurfaced many roads without improving the travel time of Lagosians, built schools without solving the educational problems, built hospitals without solving the health issues and building houses, with homelessness been on the rise.

 *ATIKU*

Is he going to fix the problem?

Atiku will fix the foundational problem of the building, but guess what he will fix it and keep the first 18 floors to himself( Maybe that was the motivation to fix it in the first place) and rent it to his friends and croonies and leave the remaining 18 floors for 200 million Nigerians to squeeze themselves in.


 *Peter Obi* 

Is he going to fix the problem?

Peter Obi will fix the foundational problem, he will also improve the aesthetics and vibes of the building to relate or connect to the youths who will call the building their own.

Having done this, he will draw the attention of the excited youths to the reality of the future, by saying with the growth rate of about 2.5 percent, this 36 floors may not be able to house your children. Let me build another 36 floors  without repeating the mistakes from the first building.

If you were able to read to the end, then you can end our incessant problems

A Surprise Presidential Candidate Leads the Race to Lead Nigeria, Poll Shows
Peter Obi scored 72% among those who have decided how to vote
Main party candidates much less favored in Premise Data poll

A third-party candidate is the top choice to become the next president of Africa’s most populous country, according to a new opinion poll.

A clear majority of respondents said they intend to vote for Peter Obi, a former state governor, in elections scheduled for February. The results of the survey conducted for Bloomberg News by Premise Data Corp. were published on Wednesday as the official campaign to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari kicked off.


Of the 92% of participants who said they’ve decided how to vote, 72% named Obi as their first choice. Of those who are still unsure, 45% said the 61-year-old is their preferred candidate.

Poll shows Obi is most-favored candidate before February election

The San Francisco-headquartered data company surveyed 3,973 Nigerians from Sept. 5-20. Respondents to the app-based poll were selected from quotas developed by age, gender and location across the country’s six geopolitical zones. Results were then weighted against the original quotas to ensure national representation. About 44% of Nigerians own smartphones, according to the Alliance for Affordable Internet.


The candidates of the two parties that have ruled Nigeria since the restoration of democracy in 1999 fared less well. Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress garnered 16% of decided voters and 23% of those yet to make up their minds. Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party tallied 9% and 17% respectively.

A former two-term governor of the southeastern Anambra state, Obi is running on the ticket of the Labour Party, which won a single seat in the Senate and House of Representatives in the last election in 2019. The APC and PDP dominate both chambers of parliament.

In a relatively short time, Obi has built up an enthusiastic base known as “Obidients” -- initially online, but increasingly in the streets -- who aim to cause an upset on Feb. 25. Still, the Labour Party has a much smaller nationwide presence than the two rival parties, which are experienced at turning out voters across the vast West African country. Obi’s supporters will need to rapidly scale up their organizational infrastructure if they’re to capitalize on the campaign’s momentum.

Obi originally sought the PDP’s nomination before withdrawing from a party election that Abubakar, a former vice president and perennial presidential candidate, won in May. Tinubu, who used to govern the commercial hub of Lagos and is the most influential politician in southwestern Nigeria, triumphed by a landslide in the APC’s primaries the following month.


The five-month race to the general elections gets underway as Nigerians contend with soaring inflation, a plunging currency and pervasive insecurity. Production of the economy’s historical mainstay -- crude oil -- has also slumped to multi-decade lows, while the Buhari administration’s debt service bill in the first quarter of the year exceeded the revenue it was able to earn.

Three-quarters of respondents said that their country is heading in the “wrong direction.” A combined 88% listed the economy and jobs, corruption, and security -- three pillars of the campaign that brought Buhari to power in 2015 -- as the most important issues facing their communities.

Voters are most concerned about economy and jobs, corruption

More than 65% named Obi as the candidate best able to improve the economy, tackle corruption and reduce insecurity. Tinubu ranked second on each measure, ahead of Abubakar.

Obi also came out in front in two other opinion polls published since Sept. 15.

Despite the general disenchantment about Nigeria’s trajectory, most respondents said that they trust the election to be run fairly and think their vote will make a difference -- even if almost half expect the polls to be marred by violence.

9/29/22, 10:49 PM - +234 806 921 7904: PDP Crisis Gets Messier — 6 NWC Members Return Millions Secretly Paid Into Their Accounts


The embattled National Chairman of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, is in a fresh crisis as six of 19 members of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) have rejected various sums of money allegedly paid into the accounts by the national chairman.

The monies range from N36million to N28.8million depending on the position of the intended recipients.

metrowatchxtra.com gathered that while the deputy national chairmen and the national secretary secretly got N36m wired into their accounts, other members of the committee got N28.850m respectively.

It was further gathered that the payment, now regarded as bribe money, came on the heels of news of a N14 billion scandal rocking the party published few days ago by a national daily.

The money to the NWC members was transfered from the party’s account with Globus bank Ltd.

Those who had returned the alleged Ayu’s money at press time, include:
1. Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja : Deputy National Chairman South.

2. Prof. Stella Effah-Attoe. National Woman Leader.

3.. Chief Dan Osi Orbih.
National Vice Chairman South-South.

4. Dr. Alli Odefa.
National vice Chairman South-West.

5. Hon Olasoji Adagunobi-Oluwatukesi
National vice chairman South-West.

6.Hon Setonji Koshoedo
Deputy National Secretary.

The guys did very well. With more training, they would get it right. 

On the 1st of October, they would have perfected the act. 

Truly proud of the young lads. 

God bless the Nigerian Army and God bless Nigeria.

9/30/22, 10:04 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I know, I agree

But if he were in Nigeria, signing would have been a problem

9/30/22, 8:43 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: @2348036928469 I’m intrigued that in about 10 political posts from you regarding this election, roughly 8-9 have been about 1 opposition candidate out of 18. Very little to none has been about selling your parties  candidate. It says a lot about the attention this one candidate is gaining and the work of 4 young men in a room
9/30/22, 9:18 PM - +234 817 950 7218: See enh Adams, I understand that you are an APC man and na there you dey chop

But to come out and start mocking Igbos about the insecurity instilled by terrorist is not ideal

Igbos sit at home on Mondays out of fear for their lives

That does not stop them from wanting a better country and most Igbos do not support IPOB

So to tell them to come out on Monday with Nigerian flag is like mocking them for being terrorized by an insurgent group

I don't exactly understand the logic behind it or even the one of telling PO to carry Nigerian flag on Monday

Has anyone asked Atiku or Buhari to go to sambisa and carry Nigerian flag?

I really don't get this persistent mockery of Igbos because of insecurity in their region
9/30/22, 9:19 PM - +234 803 692 8469: @14159348891 The same way this is selling your candidate
9/30/22, 9:20 PM - +234 803 692 8469: Even this is equally selling your candidate
9/30/22, 9:21 PM - +234 803 692 8469: Same here too
9/30/22, 9:28 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Na as you take comedy come na him I answer you with comedy😅

Your candidate is without a doubt the worst of front runners. He is clearly ill and isn't physically fit. His mental status is questionable 

He had to a same faith ticket just to increase his appeal and that isn't working. His candidacy is the most FRIGHTENING to the masses

So much baggage, from corruption to thuggery to drug allegations, age and origin questions. Even name lest I forget😪

9/30/22, 9:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Well said

The truth is that most of us who don't travel within the country and interact with the local people will always be misinformed

IPOB as a movement is not as widely accepted as these folks like to believe. But it's election season and their campaign gross lacks selling points...so anything is free game

Sadly, it's the APC led government's job to provide security and it's found time to throw jibes that indirectly highlights their ineptitude
9/30/22, 9:43 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Thank you Sir/Ma , thank you all for the kinds words. I wish you all an Obidient Nigeria 2023 and beyond, full of security, peace and prosperity 🤭 God bless you all abundantly
9/30/22, 9:52 PM - +234 706 656 2719: One Love bro . Have blast of fun sir . Greater you
9/30/22, 10:30 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly. It's APC that is supposed to secure the region and they are the ones mocking the region

I haven't even seen any tangible actions to stop the terrorism in the east

It's almost as if from presidency down they just feel it's Igbos killing themselves and nobody cares about them

Meanwhile when GEJ was president he never abandoned the insurgency in the North

Infact it was Shettima and co that were the moles that frustrated goodluck's efforts to maintain security

Imagine finding a wanted terrorist in Shetimma's house and nothing was done about it

He came up with a flimsy excuse

Then imagine if when Buhari was contesting people said he should secure his region first before saying he wants to rule Nigeria

What on earth does Peter Obi have to do with the insecurity in the east?

He is a mere civilian at this point

Why will anyone tell him to carry Nigerian flag and go to the South East on Monday?

I saw it from Reno Omokri first but that one is just a certified olodo so I didn't make much if it

But it seems its now used to score some sort of political points

It's the strangest thing
9/30/22, 10:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: They just abandoned state governors to be battling with these terrorist with no federal support

It was only when Nnamdi Kanu was making waves that they decided to do operation crocodile smile

Now crocodile is not smiling anymore abi?

No more military exercise in the East

Be like time to drop bar fit done reach
9/30/22, 10:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The truth is APC is sorely lacking campaign points, so they grasp at whatever point they can get, regardless of how illogical 

The government's strategy seems to be to send the military to kill agitators, their innocent friends, families and burn houses and shops

For the life of me I don't understand why they destroy property like people's homes

Roping Peter Obi in with IPOB is just the strategy for the weak

If Peter Obi was everything wicked they say but he is one thing he has said, then there shouldn't even be an election

*Peter Obi said that as governor for 8 years in Anambra state over 500B passed through his hands and if you find N1 stolen he'd drop out of the race*

Can anyone supporting APC or PDP beat their chest and say Tinubu or Atiku never stole government funds? 

If you're supporting a thief when you have an alternative, then you're probably deserve this government and are as wicked

A glimpse of the referral and training facility for Baze University.

Atiku set up his private university *only after he left office as vice president (* punctured by serial ASUU strikes) and when he wanted to do his master's in another school

Contrast

Datti *before contesting as vice president* has a private university and has taken loan from Sibtc to build a world class teaching hospital .

Datti is a quiet PhD holder. Atiku makes so much noise about been the candidate with the highest educational qualification ( forgetting he attended physically and finished in 3 years and cannot match the VP of of LP's credentials).


Moral

If a man could leave his university he built after he left govt to get his master's elsewhere ( he has the right too), why should you send your wards to his school or universities who suffered immensely under his stewardship as VP(1999-2007). Rather send your wards to a man who has hustled, borrowed resources, gathered the best and given tech driven solutions to our university problems.

Grant state police and see terrorism vanish 

These terrorists are not intelligent....they just have access to Ak-47...nothing smart about them

The few times IPOB and ESN went to the forests insecurity dropped in the rural farmlands in the east people were able to return to farm

Until the army that aids these terrorists came to dislodge them


One thing is clear we are approaching our elastic limit

Restructuring will happen and state police will happen

These so called ‘one million man marches’ are mostly a gathering of traders in various Nigerian towns and cities, who close down their markets (that are HEAVILY dominated by people of Southeastern origin), to do what in the military is called a show of force.

10/2/22, 6:52 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Well-done Everyone,  both to the active and Silent Obidients, who are yusful to the new Nigerian Renaissance built on first having the right family, before a right society, then a viable country.

Atongo, the next focus should be on collecting our PVCS( whether newly registered or those who for one reason haven't collected theirs in years back). Only then can the numbers in the rallies count!. We must pay tp and provide logistics( Buses, food and refreshments) for people to get their pvcs.

Music concerts will resume and only your PVC would be your entry requirement.

As Aisha Yesufu would say, this election is a fight for our individual and corporate survival.

God will not come down to solve our problems. He has given us every capacity to.

Our pvcs is whot more than 250k. It is whot a veritable future for generations unborn.


Have you gotten your *P* eter *O* bi *C* ard ( *PVC* ) to vote Peter Obi today?

This should be the new message.

Kudos to us All and the youths out there that despite BBN that was made to be a distraction, they have walked the talk and become the very politicians they desire.

10/2/22, 5:16 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The story is so confusing

Killing the GF is fathomable, like maybe in anger, blackmail, jealousy etc

But why the other woman and in a trash can?

Probably just a sociopathic serial killer
10/2/22, 5:17 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes

The trash can own na cause for concern 

Na psychopath
10/2/22, 5:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I tell you

Pesin wife? Maybe he raped and murdered her

Na doctor fa
10/2/22, 5:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: She may also be the friend of his GF
10/2/22, 5:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Who is aware of the murder
10/2/22, 5:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And was threatening him
10/2/22, 5:19 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ah that's probably true

I didn't think of that, but it wasn't mentioned
10/2/22, 5:19 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Might also be organ harvesting and sales
10/2/22, 5:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: As a doctor that is more likely 🤷🏿‍♂️
10/2/22, 5:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: There's that

WTH! This is just terrible
10/2/22, 5:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Might just be a simple case of his girlfriend threatened him with pregnancy or reporting his wife and he decided to handle blackmail with murder and then murdered her friend
10/2/22, 5:32 PM - +234 803 458 5862: Sherlock Holmes kenan!
10/2/22, 5:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I assumed as much but I couldn't find the relationship with the other woman

They also didn't mention anything about his family
10/2/22, 5:56 PM - +234 803 458 5862: Congratulations Dr. Bello Abdulshaheed on your appointment as member of *NMA NATIONAL WELFARE COMMITTEE*

10/2/22, 9:12 PM - +234 817 034 1232: I tire for Victor o🤣

We need am for the polls

E get why
10/2/22, 9:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The audacity of APC supporters sha. 

You have this as a presidential candidate and you have guts to criticise Peter Obi
10/2/22, 9:13 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Catheter in situ, adrenaline running, camera check, baba agbado on his Lance Armstrong swag
10/2/22, 9:17 PM - +234 817 034 1232: In sane places elderly people stay in nursing homes or with loved ones 

Here we have a serial old wicked rogue being supported by younger masses to lead them
10/2/22, 9:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I tell you, looking like he's 5 secs from keeling over. 

They keep trying to label Peter Obi as IPOB

Let's even say Peter Obi is a card carrying IPOB member, that he governed Anambra for 8 years, dared opposition to find a dime missing out of 500B he handled is enough reason to vote him

A politician that has been proven to have never stolen public funds? That on his CV should be enough. Every other thing is jara

But them curse some people with poverty and suffering. Because of N5 today them dey mortgage their future and their children's 😒
10/2/22, 9:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: With Buhari people could even lie about his health.

This is impossible to deny he's ailing
10/2/22, 9:21 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Some supporters are not poor or suffering...it takes a certain amount of wickedness to support him


This election like someone said...many will drink poison because it was served in a tribal glass

Others will eat poisonous food because it was served in a religious plate
10/2/22, 9:24 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Toh

That means once Tinubu wins his main work will be to prove to us intermittently that he is alive and fit...lol

E go dey drop picture and videos like this in aliquots🤣
10/2/22, 9:26 PM - +234 806 954 1554: We no want, na by force?
10/2/22, 9:27 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 🤣🤣
10/2/22, 9:28 PM - +44 7466 095552: After 5 seconds he had already slowed down 😃😃😂
They should give us a 20 second clip, I want to check something 😭
10/2/22, 9:29 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

But it's the promise of small money in my opinion

A cousin of a friend got 10M from BAT. For the kind of country that I know BAT will shape that money is the equivalent of saw dust.

Essentially 10m÷8 = 1.2M for more kidnapping and economic downturn

Think about it, if anyone right now, knowing what they know, was offered 10M for Buhari to be president, they would turn it down

If them kidnap you sef 2-5M don waka, plus the shitty currency means it'll take you years plus cooperative loans to pay back
10/2/22, 9:29 PM - +234 817 034 1232: 🤣🤣

Dem hang am for that bike before the video

If them get mind make him disembark from that bike unaided
10/2/22, 9:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: If he wins he won't give TWO SHITS about you

Remember the bullion van excuse? No, that's right, there wasn't one. He essentially said it's my money F YOU

Lekki toll gate ? Remember his comments? "Why were they there? "
10/2/22, 9:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Plenty hydration and CPR from second 10
10/2/22, 9:32 PM - +234 817 034 1232: True 

Many will reject the offer
10/2/22, 9:32 PM - +44 7466 095552: 😂😂😂😂😂
10/2/22, 9:32 PM - +234 806 566 2895: He gripped that bike for dear life while looking badass

Imagine!

One candidate is traipsing from state to state, interviews, abroad

Another one dey feel like Rambo sey him climb bike for 5 secs
10/2/22, 9:32 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 🤦🏾‍♂️
10/2/22, 9:33 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Of course
10/2/22, 9:33 PM - +44 7466 095552: 😃😃😂
10/2/22, 9:35 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Each video or photo op about him always end up in embarrassments


Goes to show that he and his handlers are bereft of ideas and are not equal to the task
10/2/22, 9:37 PM - +234 806 566 2895: About embarrassing himself, the man is shockingly consistent

Watch out for people doing the bike challenge from tomorrow 😂😂😂
10/2/22, 9:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The handler no fit do pass themselves

I can convince younger adults between 18 to 25 years...because of exposure and experience
10/3/22, 10:46 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Tinubu campaign council is filled with dodgy fellows na

To walk around with false information in my head, using it to discuss and make conclusion

I dey fear am

I almost always try to verify

Even when Obi say "Go and verify"

I go oh

Trust no man
10/3/22, 10:50 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba you can't blame them

They're floundering 

They can't complete with Obi's sincerity, intellect, age or support. Any half-smart person would give up, especially seeing how the dynamic has changed too much for them to cope but they just can't help themselves. Hence, the gaffes
10/3/22, 10:51 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You and Rufai na Siamese twins😂

I check when my nose smells falsehood but that's an ineffective strategy.

Case in point
10/3/22, 10:57 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think the problem todays politicians have is that His excellency Peter Obi introduced a new phrase which has continued to hunt every post and image online. It is simply “Go and Verify”. 
There is a paradigm shift in how the electorate engages with information thrown at them. 

@2348036928469 *Go and Verify* before you post

10/3/22, 11:04 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The honest truth is that the simple fact that they are posting a 9 year old vid as purportedly recent calls to question the earlier video. That also now has a huge❓❓❓❓
10/3/22, 11:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Another Paul Biya
10/3/22, 11:08 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba let me say publicly what we say in private 

We enjoy when they do this, the embarrassment in aftermath of exposure is always SWEEEEEEEET😂
10/3/22, 11:13 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol
10/3/22, 11:20 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The more recent one is purportedly from January. It was made in Nigeria and we all know currently Tinubu is in London

So it's quite suspicious that he felt the need to release an old video to claim fitness
10/3/22, 11:24 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I would agree because the same hand that struggled to hold a light weight paper is now firmly holding a gym stead steadily. Highly arguable
10/3/22, 11:40 AM - +234 806 566 2895: APC is shameless 

But this casts real aspersions on his health and probably confirms suspicions of ill health
10/3/22, 11:42 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly

To the discerning mind this video is the opposite of evidence of wellness

It evokes concerns about illness that I never really took serious before
10/3/22, 11:42 AM - +234 817 950 7218: And to think Shetimma is waiting to take over if this man manages to survive till election day

10/3/22, 11:46 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You're quite right

I knew he wasn't well but I just felt it was age related but now I think it's much worse
10/3/22, 11:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Scary...

A truly wicked man
10/3/22, 11:48 AM - +234 817 950 7218: And I thought he went to London for just his regular check. Like not because he had broken down or something

But now I'm not so sure

Why did Tinubu pay Buba Marwa the NDLEA director a visit?

Afterwards they did a fake show of burning the product

10/3/22, 3:29 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I think so, I'm not sure what they are trying to say by circulating this picture

Perhaps to create an impression of him buying votes or something

10/3/22, 3:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: He more than explained what happened here several times

He said on campaign and a woman tried to gift him a loaf of bread and he instead paid 10k for a loaf of bread and others selling seeing the money asked him for and he gave them

That he even remembers the incident is impressive

We just might see an extinction of the APC across board
10/3/22, 4:01 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Interesting stuff

I guess it shows the internet never forgets

This was in 2017 while campaigning for Anambra election

I hope he has learned a lesson Sha

You can't wear party shirt and be sharing money in anyway

It'll always be hard to explain and it will come back to haunt you
10/3/22, 4:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Ah this was a different incident from the one I cited
10/3/22, 4:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That's quite hopeful
10/3/22, 4:03 PM - +234 806 566 2895: True

I would like details or context because I don't believe he was buying vote with a single note but stranger things have happened
10/3/22, 4:08 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I suspect he was out campaigning and some Young people asked him for money

It's not unusual to dash people money

Everyone has been begged and has given money

But the fact that he was wearing party shirt and he was out on campaign

It's hard to argue that you weren't technically buying votes
10/3/22, 4:09 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I've been gathered multiple times in the village and eventually you'll bring out wallet and dash people small money.

But wearing PDP shirt and out on campaign changes the context
10/3/22, 4:10 PM - +234 810 006 7926: . 

It appears to me as guys saying Baba we want drink water and he gives them single notes to buy water.

Obi's frugality is lovely. In fact I like the way he miserly singles out the notes to give the guys around him

Is there a strangest possiblity that this is vote buying?

Not likely. 

Attempts to query his principles should be dismissed for lack of merit.
10/3/22, 4:12 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

That's also likely

But opposition don see food, sadly it won't work

They'll ask and he'll be honest and it'll die
10/3/22, 4:13 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Hmmm

Well...we know his nature but anyone querying has some evidence, albeit thin

10/3/22, 4:19 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Meanwhile their candidate had bullion van moving from his house in the last election oh

And he said "Yes, it's my money, I can move money if I want on anyday"
10/3/22, 4:21 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes and that's why I posited it was unlikely. Vote buying is done by those who do it on one on one and rarely as shown in the pic.

This guy is richer than the current POTUS. Yet he never shared dollars at the pdp convention to buy delegates.

The chain of evidence is fractured as we cannot conclusively say albeit thin possibility that it happened.

He has the fundamental right to give his money( legally earned ) to anyone, However the moral of doing this wearing a party uniform as highlighted by Chinedu is spot on!
10/3/22, 4:22 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That man is the epitomy of everything wrong with the political elite
10/3/22, 4:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true. Most who buy votes do it through proxies
10/3/22, 4:23 PM - +234 817 950 7218: And it wasn't even in an election he was contesting

He was campaigning for someone in governorship race for PDP in Anambra state

10/4/22, 11:10 AM - +234 803 692 8469: *THE LABOUR PARTY SENATORIAL SHORTFALL* 
 
The Nigerian Senate has 109 members!! 

INEC's final list of senate candidates shows that the Labour Party is fielding only 30 candidates. 

Labour Party has no Senatorial candidates in Bornu, Katsina, Ondo, Lagos, Kebbi, and the Ekiti States.

Labour Party has two candidates in Bauchi and Niger State. Labour has one candidate in Bayelsa and Delta States.

Assuming Labour wins the Presidency, how is Labour President going to navigate around? 

How can a Party that cannot field Candidates in the 109 districts win the Presidency?

... just asking o o o'

... after all what do I know...

10/4/22, 11:15 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Remember it's not the first time it's happened as Governor of Anambra he was in APGA and had no APGA member in the state house.


More than 2/3 of the current federal assembly members are not coming back and the House will have a heterogeneous mix.  This time the majority may not meet the constitutional requirements to impeach a sitting president.

Don't worry Salis, everything is According to Gods Grand plan
10/4/22, 11:20 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Fair question but it's irrelevant

That you field 109 candidates is no guarantee you'll win 1

It's not about fielding candidates

We have a goal... PRESIDENCY, the rest is secondary

I even would prefer a situation where the senate and house are  majorly in the opposition to be independent and  checkmate the excesses of the executive.

As regards supporting the president, the house members may this time around do the bidding of their constituents( politics is local. If they must be on the good side of the very ppl they serve and get reelected) and not a regional or rubber stamped Red and Green chambers we have had.

Look at BATIKU, already feeling lost in these elections, dancing on TikTok, exercise videos, talking about "serving" the masses when it was formerly "emi lo kan"

We just have to sustain the momentum to the finish line

10/7/22, 3:27 PM - +234 803 692 8469: Dangote enslaves Kogi and her people for over 22years bcs the past leaders sold both company and the state interest to Dangote. A state he made  his biggest fortunes to become who he is today. Excavating our resources on daily basis for over 2 decades creating environmental hazzards, trailers destroying our roads without key CSRs to the benefits of kogi communities nor state share from the industry that was originally belong to the state.

The only kabba-obajana concrete road they built was not CSR but exchange of tax remissions to FG even though they claim out of 11.5biĺlion, 5.2 was for the tax concession while the 6.2billion was for CSR. CSR oloshi

History will be very kind to this administration of GYB. This government is not just developing the present generation, but laying good foundation and creating a better place for younger generation and generations yet unborn.
10/7/22, 3:31 PM - +234 817 034 1232: On the issue of CSR you are right

Dangote should do more and the government should ensure he keeps the end of his bargain on this 

This is necessary since raw materials from catapulted him to his current status
10/7/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 692 8469: <Media omitted>
10/7/22, 3:49 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Well, I understand your position but you must understand that Nigeria is a very difficult place to do business. 
The businesses have to provide their own power,water and security.  Then,there is the ridiculous margins they have to pay banks for loans collected.  Whatever profit they make is watered down by the dollar constantly beating the naira to a pulp (especially in this government) and then there is taxation,double taxation...no, multiple taxation. Every government agency is a revenue collector and has plenty fines,fees etc they expect from business owners. They have to deal with federal revenue collectors, state revenue collectors, local government and then traditional leaders. And,then you have to buy the favour of those in government and law enforcement, or else,you will be sorry.
At the end of the day,there is no motivation to do any CSR..infact,most businesses are struggling to stay afloat and are neck deep in debts that they can't publicly talk about.
One government comes with a list of demands that they say is state's interest, then another one comes into office and state interest takes a new meaning,with fresh requirements.
10/7/22, 3:55 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Government's agenda shouldn't be to create jobs but to provide the right environment for companies that would create jobs. That's how economies level up.
We can come up with plenty explanations for the hostilities but in the end,I don't think the state benefits from all the fighting. And that's what I think that MAN was trying to say.
10/7/22, 3:58 PM - +234 806 529 3872: <Media omitted>
10/7/22, 3:59 PM - +234 803 692 8469: My brother I agree with you but, same Dangote whose lifeline company is majorly this cement factory in Kogi state has lost of CSR is Lagos, Kano and other place except Kogi.
He was even given an award of the company with the best CSR in Lagos.

Haba… Kogi had been undermined for too long.

He also has the largest coal mining site in Kogi. Kogi is second to Enugu in coal deposit. Yet you will pity this coal host communities in Kogi.

Enough of all these oppression.
10/7/22, 4:01 PM - +234 803 692 8469: It’s not fighting it’s about doing the right thing which will even protect the factory, favour more job creation and ensure provision of a conducive host community where most of the work force resides primarily.
10/7/22, 4:04 PM - +234 803 281 3842: What are the clear demands that the state is making to the dangote group?.
Please tell us. You arevinbthe government and you should know.

10/7/22, 4:14 PM - +234 803 692 8469: *NOTE*

“There is no evidence of consideration paid by
Dangote Industries Limited to Kogi State
Government from the alleged transfer of Obajana
Cement Company Plc and no dividend was paid
to the State from the profits realised from
inception of Dangote Cement Company PIc to date”

Above is extracted from the report of investigation done.

The three ingredients of an agreement are;
1. Offer
2. Acceptance
3. Consideration

If one is missing then the agreement is null and void abinitio. In this case number 3 is missing and when the company representatives were summoned by the state house of assembly they couldn’t provide the number 3 and couldn’t defend why it’s missing.
10/7/22, 4:16 PM - +234 803 692 8469: RECOMMENDATIONS.

1. Kogi State Government should take steps to
recover Obajana Cement Company Plc now
changed to Dangote Cement Company PIc,
situate in Obajana, Kogi State.

2. Kogi State Government should take steps to
recover all accrued dividends from profits made
over the years including accrued interest on
same.

3. Kogi State Government should take steps to
cancel the existing seven Certificates of
Occupancy in the name of Dangote Cement
Company PIc.

Anytime he's held accountable is good news. The problem is he has ways to giving our leaders what they desire without it trickling down to the masses

10/8/22, 12:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And that he went blank
10/8/22, 12:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I told them on your behalf that his deputy answered that question sometime ago
10/8/22, 12:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But I still think your should watch that
10/8/22, 12:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I will watch but there's no need to compare both candidates.

Even if Peter Obi incidentally had a brain fart, he is still a vastly better choice than Tinubu because his government was corruption free. 

What that means is he demonstrated practically how to annihilate corruption. What better proof does any objective person need? 🤷🏿‍♂️

Also, one candidate has a known source of income and not a single hint of corruption. He has even bragged that if you find a Naira missing from the 500B that passed through his hands as governor, he will drop out of the race

Tinubu's is CORRUPTION PERSONIFIED
10/8/22, 12:59 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Adamu Garba also lies a lot that I honestly for the life of me don't watch his timeline or read his posts

10/8/22, 1:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Mad man😂😂
10/8/22, 1:08 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly Adamu is not intelligent if he was impressed by what Tinubu said

Anyway Adamu is a criminal ab initio. That is why he thinks extending credit lines like Tinubu is how to tackle corruption 

Peter gave an accurate example on how to tackle corruption in his response

If they steal phones from my shop in computer village. The best way to tackle it is to install CCTV's, because if I go away to chase the thieves more people will enter my shop and steal more before I come back


That is why Buhari's administration has stolen more than that of Abacha

Adamu that cornered 83 million funds for campaign is who I should be exchanging words with. Haba jama

10/8/22, 2:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: A gov had 500 billion pass through him in 8 years and he built a little under 1000 km of roads and still left 75 billion in savings. With Grants to sec schs.

While the other had trillions pass through him( forget the lies he didn't get allocation during Obasanjo time. It was only the LGs that didn't get their allocation, but Lagos state got her allocation in full for 8 years). And you cannot point to one super highway he built befitting of Lagos. He left Lagos with debts.

The other candidate was VP for 8 years and never believed we should save. He was more to spending than obj who insisted on saving. Privatized All national Assets and non is working optimally today, not nitel, not the discos. None!


We have their antecedents and can draw red flags from their stewardship.

PO is the only past public servant who is not on pension. Can we say the same for Tinubu or Atiku?

Tinubu was gov for 8 years and there was no world class hospital he built. He travels abroad to seek care, throwing billions of public funds to fuel and maintain his private jet. Atiku runs a private university and it was not world class enough to do his master's there, but he appeals to parents to send their wards to his school.

The leaders we choose are a reflection of us. And their first day on the job will be a reflection of our voters cards
10/8/22, 2:33 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Gbam! 

Well said, absolutely nothing more to add
10/8/22, 3:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: As gov of Anambra state there were a few to none successful bank robberies in 7 years of his stewardship.

We remember Evans the kidnapper who operated in Anambra and his life was made difficult and he ran to Lagos and became a billionaire. Peter Obi demolished the houses and properties of confirmed kidnappers. Evans became notorious and successful in another state, because leadership was lacking and until someone had the courage to take the bull by the horns and have him tried.

Can Tinubu say same for bank robbers, crimes, cult clashes, junkies clashing in parks? in Lagos under his stewardship.

Some still say Lagos was safer under Ambode and I may want to agree because I lived there at the time and there was no nook and crane my Ambulance did not go in the dead of the night.

Can we say the same for Atiku if he became governor of Adamawa state in 1999?

How many properties of confirmed druglords, kidnappers does Tinubu have the temerity to revoke their c of o s.


How many accounts of corrupt friends and political frenemies could Atiku order the agencies involve to freeze?

Anambra was the worst state to govern, before peter Obi as the Uba brothers held sway and made God Fatherism the order of the day. Anambra became relatively peaceful after he became the first person to become a governor in a PDP dominated South East Nigeria. Till date Anambra still votes APGA after Peter Obi's foundation.
10/8/22, 3:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Campaign council consisting of known criminal elements. They're even brazen with their use of thugs
10/8/22, 3:44 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Tinubu's credit policy is a copy and paste module with many pitfalls,when you attempt it in our economy. 
1st, we have a huge unemployment and under-employmentment percentage (almost 60%). These people are not credit worthy .
2nd..our inflation rate makes it impossible for lenders to give credits without ridiculous profit margins. No bank gives single digit profit loans. You cannot credit a credit based society with 25-30% profit margins. It would be better to just save your money and pay when u have the cash.
Tinubu's idea no go work...that's why there was laughter in the video when he asked Jim ovia to look into it. Am sure Jim was thinking " we have baba and ko le work (won't work)".
 However, Peter seems to allude to changing the system (said change a thing here or there). He was abit vague  sha.
10/8/22, 3:47 PM - +234 810 006 7926: And the fear of the east seceeding by the north is not holding water any more.

There is an equal  or more no of Nigerians of Ibo origin who leave in other parts of the country than in the east, making legimate income from well structured enterprise.

They can't break away if majority or a substantial number live outside the east. 
The clamour for breakaway( though hijaked and abused now) like was obtained in the south south during obj/yaradua is because they feel alienated and think they can be better off themselves.

The approach is simple. Liase with all the breakaway groups and make them see reason to put Nigeria first within a timeline. If there is no cease fire at the end of negotiations, tact and  outright dealing of such groups should set an example for anyone in the future who may think he or she has the monopoly of violence

10/9/22, 7:12 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Omale listen well

Everything happening in terms of insecurity in the east isn't IPOB
10/9/22, 7:13 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Why is it so hard to imagine that there people who stand to benefit from insecurity in the east and find a convenient cover under IPOB?
10/9/22, 7:14 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Not difficult to understand
10/9/22, 7:14 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Aha!
10/9/22, 7:14 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Not everything but lots of things
10/9/22, 7:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You have no proof so just leave this thing
10/9/22, 7:16 AM - +234 806 566 2895: The reason I say this is that, this willful acceptance is what politicians aim to exploit
10/9/22, 7:16 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We know some of the politicians, including the SE governors benefit a lot from it, same way the Northern elites are benefitting from BH and other groups of terrorists
10/9/22, 7:17 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Ehen now you're talking

Even IPOB have exposed some breakaway members to police that shows their disapproval of the insecurity in the east
10/9/22, 7:21 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Let them do more. Not just IPOB, the greedy Igbo politicians are problems. Though none of these will stop the movement anyway
10/9/22, 7:23 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree they should do more, else they will get blamed but they're also not the government

Instead of the government investigating and exposing criminal elements, they use force and prefer extermination because they're Igbos unlike bandits🤷🏿‍♂️
10/9/22, 8:05 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Na why I copy omale
He will still not be impressed 

Lol
10/9/22, 8:07 AM - +234 706 614 3518: Thanks my fellow Titans and honourable colleagues for celebrating with me.

10/9/22, 8:12 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
10/9/22, 8:32 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You can't depend on a failed federal government to guarantee security. For le, we should hold our governors more accountable.
10/9/22, 8:36 AM - +234 806 566 2895: So you want to depend on people to do jobs they're not paid for?

Hold governors accountable?

Hope you know police and military are directed by the federal? Till we have state police we can only peripherally blame governors
10/9/22, 8:49 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Most of the people terrorising SE arrested so far are from the SE, including the ones arrested by Soludo
10/9/22, 8:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You can't really hold state governors accountable when there is no state police

Many times during massacre by Fulani herdsmen we hear state governors calling both the army and police and they refuse to act saying they are awaiting orders from Abuja

Pray tell how do you hold them accountable??
10/9/22, 8:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Toh!
10/9/22, 9:21 AM - +234 806 566 2895: So because someone is from SE they're automatically IPOB? 😦

A man who supervised the rigging of Buhari into power for the seconds term should not be trusted with 2023 elections.


The BVAS should be used regardless of the outcome
10/13/22, 9:18 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I think we can manage him. Any new face will be manipulated by Politicians. I may trust him 65 percent of the times. BVAS was his idea, but his stained past like you rightly posited is a concern that must not be swept under the carpet, but will put him more in the spotlight.

He has everyday to either confirm our public trust or confirm our fears. Either Way BVAS *must* stay. Politicians of the old order hate the idea that what happened in Osun may have a far reaching tsunami nationwide.

10/13/22, 9:02 PM - +234 803 635 0279: So I saw this video on Facebook and was so bothered at the level of our healthcare decay.
10/13/22, 9:09 PM - +234 803 623 3688: Heartbreaking.......May you find Eternal Rest Rico .
10/13/22, 9:16 PM - +234 803 635 0279: @2348036233688 did you notice the way the hospital staffs were videoing while he died?
It could be anyone in that position.
We need to save the health sector for our sakes
10/13/22, 9:25 PM - +234 803 623 3688: I totally agree with you my dear.... but honestly one wonders where to start from, the issues in this country is endless.
I doubt if he had any resuscitation on arrival at the hospital.
10/13/22, 9:25 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Very poor ethical training

One lawsuit will reset every brain
10/13/22, 9:26 PM - +234 803 623 3688: But then even at the teaching hospitals we work the basic things are not available.
10/13/22, 9:26 PM - +234 803 635 0279: It's not about the work it's about the attitude.
10/13/22, 9:29 PM - +234 803 623 3688: I agree, the voice in the background sounded like a nurse I guess the rest are hospital attendants making the video.

We will get the full story soon
10/13/22, 9:30 PM - +234 803 623 3688: May the Lord comfort his family.....this will break them the more
10/13/22, 10:05 PM - +234 817 950 7218: There is no evidence that it was health workers making the video

It seems it was those who brought him to the hospital making it


It's quite clear that there wasn't a doctor, talk less of a surgeon in that hospital at the time this person was taken there.

These nurses were likely doing all they knew to do, call the doctor on the phone who probably asked that they take the man for a scan

There seemed to be no resuscitation or action towards saving him

Likely a preventable death

We have a serious man power problem for starters, what would have saved this man was a general surgeon on ground for emergency exploratory laparotomy.

Basic FAST to confirm hemoperitoneum and go in for emergency surgery after resuscitation

The effects of a skilled member of staff at the time of an emergency changes soo much

But they are jacking for plab as I type this
10/13/22, 10:28 PM - +234 803 635 0279: He probably had a head injury  with a blunt chest injury.
It's possible he could have been saved but as you said ,those to help out where somewhere far
10/13/22, 11:27 PM - +234 909 679 4850: Happy birthday Chuchu...keep winning!
10/13/22, 11:45 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Thank you Esther...

10/14/22, 12:37 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Happy birthday to our own doctopreneur changing the narrative. Greater heights. Break boundaries and soar!
10/14/22, 12:40 AM - +234 810 006 7926: We need to disrupt the default leadership and everything will fall in place. If we must get it right we must start with the choice of who leads us come 2023 from the top to the bottom.
10/14/22, 2:23 AM - +234 803 658 2567: Oh dear.

10/14/22, 7:48 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Totally disagree
10/14/22, 7:58 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True
10/14/22, 7:59 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He is right

Once you have a bad president nothing will change 

Health care too
10/14/22, 8:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Easy to say
10/14/22, 8:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: My dear some things are never from who is the president
10/14/22, 8:02 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And I must say that except policy written in papers who which had nothing to do with President
10/14/22, 8:02 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But legislative nothing top to bottom works
10/14/22, 8:03 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Even policy that works are actually from the very of interest group and attentiveness of the legislative to their people
10/14/22, 8:03 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Everyone talks as if the president is everything that we need
10/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: While having good president is great. He or she is just one thing of our a body of Government
10/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Health care is guided by policy
10/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Policy implementation are not by government
10/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It is agency and organisations
10/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The rule that guide policy is by the court of law and the agency
10/14/22, 8:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: How is the president culpable for that
10/14/22, 8:05 AM - +234 803 097 7516: We need to understand how policy work
10/14/22, 8:05 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Buhari released budget of 1 trillion naira for health care budget last week

Out of it

400 billion is for capital expenditure 

But he is going to use 14 billion naira for Internet subscription in aso villa
10/14/22, 8:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: This is totally different and nothing to do with misconduct
10/14/22, 8:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: What happens to the budget sheet release of not in the hands of President or executive
10/14/22, 8:06 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It is the ministry, the agency, the legislative and the court of law
10/14/22, 8:06 AM - +234 817 034 1232: All these policy

If there is no money for it....the policy is not useful

These things are simple but we tend to overcomplicate things
10/14/22, 8:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: How is budget and misconduct by a health worker related
10/14/22, 8:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: How is the president responsible for your negligence as a doctor
10/14/22, 8:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Guys calm down
10/14/22, 8:07 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't be too sensitive just cos Buhari is a mess
10/14/22, 8:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Everyone agrees Buhari is a mess
10/14/22, 8:08 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Buhari and his likes are depending on these kinds of arguments to escape the fact that they are responsible for the healthcare system
10/14/22, 8:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Everyone agrees Peter is a POTENTIAL GOOD
10/14/22, 8:08 AM - +234 817 034 1232: It's not just Buhari 

Even Jonathan too messed up
10/14/22, 8:08 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't let's us be too expectant of him to do our responsibility
10/14/22, 8:08 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The bulk of the blame rests on the presidency
10/14/22, 8:09 AM - +234 803 097 7516: It's not different from a fantastic who thinks his god does magic
10/14/22, 8:09 AM - +234 803 097 7516: By those who are blind to leadership
10/14/22, 8:09 AM - +234 817 034 1232: They are very related
10/14/22, 8:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And those who don't understand how policy are made, funded, implemented, and evaluated
10/14/22, 8:10 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay
10/14/22, 8:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The presidency is only one tiny thing in policy. He only stamp and agree to a bill already pushed by legislators
10/14/22, 8:17 AM - +234 817 271 4735: OPEN LTTER FROM OGBONNAYA ONU TO
PRESIDENT BUHARI

Dear President Muhammadu Buhari,
I hope this mail finds you in good spirits…
I must not fail to thank you once again for helping to deepen our democracy by leading the change movement that saw an opposition party capture power at the centre for the first time in Nigerian history. We did so at a time when the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party had boasted that it would rule for unbroken 60 years whether the people liked it or not. We were able to make such a defining history because of your austere and incorrigible pedigree. We believed history had placed you in a position to become the greatest African leader—ever.
Unfortunately, fellow Nigerians, including your very self, have found out the hard way: Any serious setback from old age or ill-health is not a recipe for effective leadership. Make no mistake: One must not mock old age or ill-health, as these conditions are in most cases beyond human control. Moreover, our basic norms dictate that we show empathy for the adversities of others. Yet, it is a gross disservice to humankind for politicians who are challenged by either old age or ill-health to knowingly offer themselves for positions where such infirmities can hinder their performance.
The significance of physical fitness in leadership explains why candidates seeking power in advanced democracies undergo vigorous health scrutiny before voters can take them seriously. Mr President, you are a living witness. You have not hidden the fact that the challenges associated with old age do not augur well with the demands of your office. It is not surprising, therefore, that you have not been able to perform to the best of your abilities.
To make matters worse, the National Leader of our dear party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the master strategist, who was supposed to serve as a stabilising force, is suffering from a similar sad fate. His predicament is even worse. Within the past seven years, he has domiciled in foreign hospitals more than you have done. Needless to mention that his recent public outings do not portray a man who is physically or mentally fit for any serious party leadership.
The cumulative effect is that things have truly fallen apart in our party, as well as Nigeria in general. Today, the level of corruption, which you had declared would kill Nigeria unless Nigeria kills it, is now unfathomable. Today, our party—the All Progressives Congress—with Tinubu as its national leader, has become a safe haven for notorious corrupt kingpins who were indicted while at the PDP. Today, our party does not appear to have any ideological, moral or ethical difference from the much-discredited PDP.
The most shameless yet is that the APC has nominated the same Tinubu as its presidential candidate for the upcoming 2023 elections. The implication is that corruption has been embraced as a way of life under your very own regime. Common sense dictates that, if Tinubu is to prevail, but may God forbid, you would be handing over to a politician who is not only challenged by the stark frailties of poor health and old age but also someone who is widely disdained for being one of the most cancerous poster characters for corruption in Africa. Mr President, if Tinubu prevails, you will go down in history as the most shameless political hypocrite—ever.
It is necessary to remark here that I do not discount the contributions of Tinubu in Nigerian history. Eulogising him in a 2017 piece, “I pity Tinubu,” I did not hesitate to write that “if dynamic opposition is the life-wire of democracy, it is very fitting then to name him the saviour of Nigeria’s current democratic journey. Tinubu, more than any other Nigerian, nurtured and sustained the opposition movement that removed the Peoples Democratic Party from power.”

However, as someone who has professed political leadership for decades in many advanced democracies, I definitely know the difference between the qualities of a political strategist and the qualities of a president of a country.

I must also admit that Tinubu could not have been a candidate you would wish as a successor. You wanted a level playing ground in our party. But the corrupt cabal within the APC took advantage of your condition to outwit you and hand the prize to the highest bidder. Take, for example, Tinubu’s Presidential Campaign Council, where he hoodwinked you to become its chairman. Look at the kind of re-cycled corrupt characters therein. Mr President, why are you allowing these characters to further tarnish your image? The saving grace is that the 2023 presidential election presents a golden opportunity to not only redeem your incorrigible legacy but to also save Nigeria from total collapse.
The three candidates with the potential to succeed you are Atiku Abubakar, Peter Obi and Bola Tinubu.
On one hand, we can both agree that Atiku and Tinubu are the ‘same ten and ten pence’—the two most influential henchmen of Nigeria’s ageless corrupt oligarchy. In short, to elect any of the two is an errant sin. Please do not have a hand in such a shameless fall from grace. If still in doubt, besides their poor health conditions, please consider that neither of them can in good conscience campaign against corruption. Combine that with the fact that no Nigerian leader, whether military or civilian, has ever assumed the governance of the country with the type of corrupt background well known of Atiku and Tinubu. Think back, Mr President!!
On the other hand, we have Peter Obi of the Labour Party. Like you, he is well known for the frugal management of resources and has no record of corruption. Like you, he does not buy votes. Like you, he is determined to kill corruption, as you would wish. Like you in 2015, instead of waiting till election day to deploy looted funds to rig elections, Obi has demonstrated the physical ability to traverse the entire country to ask for votes. Luckily for you and Nigeria, unlike you, he is younger and in a better state of health to overcome the unfortunate frailties that hindered your performance. Moreover, he has a clear vision and the character to unleash Nigeria’s abundant potential to greatness.
Of course, I can relate to the burden associated with promoting a candidate of the opposition party. But as I had stated while equally endorsing Obi, we must not hide behind the bogus toga of political parties, tribes and religions to allow a crooked clique to dictate our future. I emulated President Olusegun Obasanjo and other progressives, who chose country over party to endorse you in 2015. I took a page from Colin Powell, an eminent American patriot and lifelong member of the Republican Party, who crossed party lines to endorse Barack Obama of the Democratic Party in 2008. Powell saw Obama as a transformational figure who could inspire a new generation of Americans.

President Muhammadu “Okechukwu” Buhari, your moment in time is now. A new generation of Nigerians beckons you to stand on the right side of history. The posterity beckons you to recognise that the 2023 election is a struggle between the nation’s corrupt oligarchy versus progressive Nigerians anchored by Mr Obi. The posterity beckons you to also demonstrate true patriotism by choosing country over religious, ethnic and party affiliations. The posterity beckons you to then go forth and endorse Obi, an untainted character, a quintessential patriot, a visionary and a generational figure, who has come to represent the democratic revolution the Nigerian masses, as well as your very self, have long sought.

A typology of an obidient and yusful Nigerian who has turned waste from consumption to wealth from production.

The msg is simple and unambiguous. PO/Datti is the ONLY team from the rest who can bring us out of the woods.
10/16/22, 9:04 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Still have this inkling Buhari has something up his sleeves and it is not to preserve this country. We had a president who was emotionally pained from scars in the past, who serially contested to be president to get his pound of flesh. He had only one aim, and though he was not prepared to be president, each time he tried, he was prepared by the singularity of purpose to actualize his agenda.

He got a platform in APC who had BAT and Atiku as founding members. While they accepted him without knowing his agenda because they believed it will get to their turn when he leaves,if they support him. 

Atiku left APC and went to PDP because, he knew he could not actualize his ambition if he remained in APC, as a northerner could not hand over to another from the same party. He came back to Pdp he founded only to realize a new Sheriff was in town in Wike who stood by the party and funded it after he left PDP in annoyance because Jonathan was seeking re-election. He wanted to be PDP flag bearer in 2019 after Jonathan single term. He claimed it was the turn of the north, not because he had the interest of the north at heart, but because of his selfish ambition. 

Come to think of it. Atiku was vice president of Nigeria for 8 years, and the GDP of the whole 19 northern states is a little over 1 billion USD, compared to Lagos who has a GDP of about 40 billion USD.

Tinubu remained in APC, with the hope that, Buhari will hand over to him. As it seems Buhari may just be interested in his personal agenda and ensure a free and fair elections as a cover/ smokescreen. This non commitment has made BAT and his team shoulder their responsibility.

We have 2 politicians from 1992 who have had life ambitions to be president, unfortunately, the children who were born after 1992 may be the ones to determine their fate. Did they do enough in the stewardship as public officers to ensure these teenagers live well and have no cause to complain , leaves more to be desired.

The claim that it is the old women and market women who votes and not youths may be suicidal, because they no longer have farmlands to go to or have been kidnapped, raped and their wards not gainfully employed. These are the dynamics that has changed. 
More than half of Nigerians who are registered to vote never come out to vote from previous elections because they were a little comfortable and would rather face their buisnesses or rest because their votes may not count.However, the harsh realities and frustrations have brought the out of that comfort zones and fortunately they are beginning to think their votes may count this time. This new dynamics and  reality, is going to see a surge of voters in the 2023 General elections.

Buhari has never demonstrated his commitment to one Nigeria. At least his bias for appointments, has proved that. Very rash and brash decisions have been made. Fortunately the Destiny of Nigeria is bigger than any one selfish interest or agenda and will consume anything in the contrary. This reality is what the establishment needs to come to terms with.

I strongly believe Buhari's agenda was to islamize Nigeria, without respecting the secular state as enshrined in the constitution. He could not acheive this as fast as he thought he could be becoming president as he was engulfed with bigger problems that took his attention.
He therefore needed force and the Afghanistan style in pace for time before he leaves office and that is why he has been sympathetic to ISWAP, BH and yielded a big stick on IPOB and the Odua nation agitators. His failure to unite rather than be biased has made him suspect and with some circumspect culpable.

10/18/22, 12:33 PM - +234 817 950 7218: He thinks we are saving our trees and our forest because of the West? He thinks we should plant trees to save our land only if they pay us?

To me it shows a rather poor understanding of the situation. Quite shallow

Also, the west already paid millions of dollars for the Paris Club refund

This money was supposed to help poorer nations resort to cleaner and safer forms of energy. What did we do with ours? The money was distributed between states and the Federal government and squandered

I remember it was an exciting time for governors

So much free cash, the "good" governors used it to clear outstanding salaries and the others just made it disappear

I know of no evidence that we tried to clean up our energy

Meanwhile we are still flaring our natural gas which is a powerful and major source of energy. That is what Russia is currently using to hold Europe by the balls. The same natural gas we have and flare

If we were wise wouldn't we have used the money to solve our power problem and convert natural gas to clean energy?

And this man is saying we should continue cutting trees for firewood and we shouldn't plant more because it is THIER climate change

Ridiculous
10/18/22, 12:35 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I hope he is really thinking that way, which if he is, it shows his level of understanding of what climate change is. Same man applauded El-Rufai for transforming Kaduna state from a "rotten state to a bad one"
10/18/22, 12:37 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Let's get one thing clear🤣

Nothing holy can be poisoned; talk more of being eaten by rats

Let nobody blaspheme holy things

Tinubu does not understand metaphor at least not in his current state of mind

And if one has to explain extensively what he meant....then Tinubu was talking gibberish
10/18/22, 12:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: After looting funds given to them by the west they don't want climate change reforms 

They must do it oh

10/18/22, 12:43 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You see when Peter Obi said he didn't know much about climate change, they derided him

But the man is honest to a fault. Instead of talking out of his arse, he just simply I don't know much about it but my government will look into it

That's how you want your president to sound
10/18/22, 12:44 PM - +234 803 513 3391: Congratulations Dr Jireh, Chingy and Julfa.👏👏👏
10/18/22, 12:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Oh is that what he said? Fair enough, he should employ. I know about climate change and I know we need to do the exact opposite of what Tinubu is suggesting
10/18/22, 12:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: *employ me

The truth is that it's a systemic thing. I personally don't think they're more evil than some civil servants

Everyone exploiting people with the weapons at their disposal, uniformed men using guns, civil servants and bereaucracy, manipulation. If civil servants had guns it'll be the same

The system just has to change. We need sanity and that is what Peter Obi represents. The others epitomize everything evil with this country

10/23/22, 9:53 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This man used to be lean and spoke the truth by c'mon sense now he is fat and has become silent always behind Atricku.

Anambra despite her small land mass and been the erosion capital of the country, under PO exported Vegetables whot 5 million dollars, making them less dependent on bail out funds.

Don't forget there had just discovered oil a few years prior, but PO did not as governor depend on oil proceeds but rather on proceeds from export of vegetables, and human capital investments etc.


 Under him, innoson gained foundation and traction.

We need a president who under extreme conditions,  acheived all he did and do more now.

We need a president who will produce an environment for more innosons, flutterwaves, paystack,nordfords, Umza rice etc.

He has employed many Nigerians ( till date)as chairman of fidelity bank in his late 30s, in which he has majority shares.


He donated to displaced victims from natural disasters in the past(2012-2014), including Haiti. 

PO connects to our problems and has the capacity insolving them.

In 8 staggered years, punctuated by 2 illegit impeachments, he built close to 1000 km of roads( mostly new rural roads). Buhari in his 8 years of smooth transition constructed less than 5000 km of new roads across the less than a million sq meters area of the geographical space of Nigeria.

Nigeria does not need a leader in Atricku who will be campaigning is Samuel Ogbemudia stadium Benin, when a neighboring state of Bayelsa is engulfed in floods. 

Nigeria does not need a leader in Tinubu who is struggling to put a manifesto together and constitute a campaign list while states are getting flooded and knows nothing about climate change.

We need a leader who will be bold enough to suspend his campaign even though it comes to him at a personal cost( don't forget LP needs more publicity and inroads). A leader who will put the country and Nigerians first. A leader who will will make you feel like a Nigerian irrespective of which part of the country you reside or irrespective environmental or personal mishap your going through.

Nigeria is so bad, we need PO too bad.

10/23/22, 6:39 PM - +234 703 613 6886: Reno is just an annoying person.
10/23/22, 6:39 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Ro Reno was bought over by Atiku to do only one thing Demarket Obi. Same job description for Okowa. Atiku does not have the morals to engage Obi directly and has not forgiven Obi for quietly leaving the pdp without his Knowing. A decision he would have frustrated if he had known. 

Atiku believes Obi has changed the dynamics and it is not to his favour.

Who cares what a septuagenarian selfish interests are?  

Reno is a lost soul seeking relevance and like in your emoji deserves our eternal silence to his rants and tantrums
10/23/22, 6:41 PM - +234 810 006 7926: To say the least. I have always believed he doesn't even understand what he is professing.
10/23/22, 6:51 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Obi has taken the lead and the other candidates now follow. By Tuesday Atiku will be forced to visit one or two sites, following in the example set by Obi( He followed as VP under Obj and Following Obi as a presidential candidate).

For one who deleted his tweet on Deborah is tweeting about end SARS( just wandering if the northerners who he derided by saying they were not on social media ,were going to read his tweet.) 

Politics is not on social media and yet you have a social media rep to throw spanners in the wheels.

Let's see how the demands of the campaigns will take on the health of the candidates. Obi has made the campaigns more tedious and daunting in the history of campaigns( Never in our history have candidates for party Primaries travel to 35 states to campaign). 

Let's see how Atiku will comfront Obi directly on Nov 15 when we have the first series of Presidential debates and vice versa

10/25/22, 12:25 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Flood is happening now, Buhari gives Minister 3 months to come up with a flood *PREVENTION* plan

😪
10/25/22, 12:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I was going to jump and pass, but the temptation of a little spanner in your wheel was overwhelming. 

While I like to be critical of Buhari’s  govt policies, I think that we already have the floods and can only be reactive to this present disaster by means of addressing the crises this present floods present. 

No harm and infact a proactive action towards defining prevention for future potential floods is in order. I might be unclear what your dissapointment with the headline is
- the proactiveness to develop a prevention plan where they previously failed?
- Or the timeline given to the minister
- Or the timing of this decision.
10/25/22, 12:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't have a problem with a prevention plan. But why is there a timeline on a prevention plan? It doesn't make sense

This is disaster management cycle. We need two things now, response and rehab

We are overwhelmed by the impact... Is there even a plan from the Federal for response and rehabilitation? States are responding independently

So why is a prevention plan a priority, seeing as we are nearing dry seasons and this may soon be past but the focus now should be on response especially since most states are affected
10/25/22, 12:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: There's nothing proactive about that, it's just saving face. Respond and show people you care about their lives, but no

Is there any plan to deal with the inflation and economic fallout of this flooding? Because the next six months will be brutal to low and middle income families

10/25/22, 12:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Victor you're speaking English

People are dying and homes have been flooded for 2-3weeks but you're saying glibly it will come
10/25/22, 12:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You know the beureaucracy involved with Govt responses an deployment of resources or response time
10/25/22, 12:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Between directives and action
10/25/22, 12:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Did you see why the governor was angry in his press briefing?

7 out of 8 LGA are 70% gone and you're saying it's coming

That's why the prevention plan is amusing to me
10/25/22, 12:50 PM - +234 817 034 1232: They will fold their hands 

This is Buhari's 8th year...and their have been yearly floods for 8 years

So the simple analysis is that he will not be proactive and he will do nothing

10/25/22, 12:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It's sooo annoying because they've had this information for months now

The billions of naira spent to buy luxury vehicles for Niger's government could have helped to a degree here
10/25/22, 12:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Thank you
10/25/22, 12:54 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Some of us actually have real family members in Bayelsa and somethings are quite insensitive!
10/25/22, 12:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The truth is that governments all over the world can be informed about disasters well ahead and still be unable to address all of the needs. This is where Philantropist etc come in
10/25/22, 12:54 PM - +234 817 034 1232: What is 12, 000 metric tonnes of food going to do for 1.4 million people 

How does this help?
10/25/22, 12:55 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Non profits and everyone also pitching in
10/25/22, 12:55 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Don’t get me wrong
10/25/22, 12:55 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Very amusing
10/25/22, 12:55 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The scale of this flood is not like anything previously seen. My point is simply to say whether any steps have been taken at all.
10/25/22, 12:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Forget what you're reading Chibu

Have the 12 metric tonnes arrived?

How much was the budget, was what supplied up to 12 tons first, before we decide if it was insufficient?
10/25/22, 12:57 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Over the last 5-10 years, I have come to realize that it is the easiest to critic Govt actions from outside. The ball game is totally different when you sit on the decision making sit and can see the available pool of funds.
10/25/22, 12:57 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Of course it hasn't arrived because they always lie

But assuming it has arrived...how does this help 1.4 million people?
10/25/22, 12:58 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Doesn’t mean i side with the Govt and I honestly feel for the people of Bayelsa and other states suffering this disaster. It’s not something we want to experience at all
10/25/22, 12:58 PM - +234 806 537 0692: There is real video trending where people were being one cup rice each ... Maybe that was part of it.
10/25/22, 12:58 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: <Media omitted>
10/25/22, 12:59 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: No jokes it’s a grim Situation out there
10/25/22, 12:59 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Kai!

Baba you're approaching this badly. You're sounding like a government apologist

I didn't even make the mistake of comparing this to Countries like US where what they did in Florida was impressive

See eh, if you've visited any camp, you'll weep. If federal government was apprised, makeshift camps would be built, evacuation efforts to high ground etc

The response was driven by people and but for the resilience of Nigerians thousands would have died

But you're essentially saying even if they knew they may not have been able to do anything
10/25/22, 12:59 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The lack of access to the rest of the country is even more crippling
10/25/22, 1:00 PM - +234 817 034 1232: This is not so

The solution to this is simply  build a dam

How much does a dam cost abeg?

Cameroon a small country built theirs and we are always at their mercy

And you say the government shouldn't be criticised

Haba!
10/25/22, 1:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Sometimes it's easier to see from outside

You're excusing efforts that came well after floods had done their work
10/25/22, 1:00 PM - +234 817 034 1232: And they siphon the rest
10/25/22, 1:01 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Your last statement has completely misrepresented everything I said.
10/25/22, 1:02 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I paraphrase. Even with enough warning, the Govt will make an effort but it may never be enough to address the scale of this disaster. We have seen disasters in Haiti where the Govt was handicapped and they required international help. I am simply saying the flood disaster in Nigeria is on that scale
10/25/22, 1:02 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Anyebe, maybe what you are trying to say is not coming out right or not coming out as intended ... Cos you actually sounded like a Government apologist!
10/25/22, 1:03 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You can never address all of the needs yes, my point is that NOTHING was done when it mattered

You are saying something has been done because of news headlines abi?

There's a long way between headlines and the actual response and I'm saying for Bayelsa nothing from Federal. Delta too very likely
10/25/22, 1:03 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And this dam falls into which stage of planning ? Immediate? Cos we are discussing on th spot solutions
10/25/22, 1:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The Govt has failed ab initio not learning from previous floods. We are not dwelling on that as we speak.
10/25/22, 1:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Please leave this matter

The dam issue has been one that should have been done since

Multiple governments are at fault
10/25/22, 1:05 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Unfortunately, the same Buhari was in power when the Dam agreement was made ... If I get my history right!
10/25/22, 1:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly don't know what to say
10/25/22, 1:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let me give you an example of what I mean. The Lagos state has began warming residents of a particular set of areas to relocate because of imminent flooding. While they may not have the resources to rehabilitate everyone, I can assure you that if you check well enough, several of the flood prone areas particularly river banks have had Govt warnings over the years to avoid developing residential areas in those places
10/25/22, 1:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The people have probably not hid to these warnings.
10/25/22, 1:08 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If the Govt enforced these relocations, we would call them heartless
10/25/22, 1:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I like that you have finally fingered previous successive govts. Which brings us back to the proactiveness of this Govt to review such performance even if it’s all for aesthetics and profer solutions
10/25/22, 1:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Smiles a Govt apologist will argue blindly. I am finding common grounds with you and ensuring there is a logic to our various stand points
10/25/22, 1:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: No one will score this Govt a D on its response to the floods I can assure you.
10/25/22, 1:11 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I totally agree they failed. My first comment was to question Roland’s disappointment on a potential plan to mitigate another flood in the future
10/25/22, 1:11 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Victor for the purpose of clarity, I'll state my point again.

You can't prevent all damage, but you can definitely mitigate it by minimizing the loss of life and property. Life is the most important thing and it doesn't require complex steps

I'll state them so you understand how nonchalant this government is

1. Setup up IDP camps in each LGA on high ground

2. Potable water sources in tank

3. WASH facilities, make shift toilets

4. Stock medical supplies

5. Inform partner organizations

6. Inform host communities, conduct evacuation drills and assist evacuation

Please state one thing I have said that is complex or useless
10/25/22, 1:11 PM - +234 806 537 0692: That's why I said ... 'Sounded like'

Am sure that is not the intension.
10/25/22, 1:12 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The people who collected bribes to allow them build there nko? 

Has anyone sacked them?
10/25/22, 1:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Points 1,2- 4 as you have stated requires access routes to these communities if I am correct. And we know unless I am wrongly informed that access routes to Bayelsa have been greatly compromised. Would this in anyway delay these responses even if they were already available?
10/25/22, 1:14 PM - +234 806 566 2895: These are just a few and guess what, they're cost effective

People left flooded areas of their own recognizance

If you no get boat in some places you die

See eh, I'm very angry

I just hope you see my point but I think I'll stop here
10/25/22, 1:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: All your points are valid. The operationalization has several kinks you are not factoring in or assuming they do not exist.
10/25/22, 1:15 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Jesus Victor there were access routes before the flood na😦

During the flood no canoes or boats were funded by the government to evacuate people
10/25/22, 1:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I believe that risk management is a major part of disaster response
10/25/22, 1:16 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I thought these things were in response to a flood
10/25/22, 1:16 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Or you are proposing a proactive approach before the flood happened?
10/25/22, 1:17 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Victor the things I have been speaking about were strategies to put in place before and during the disaster

Preparedness and response
10/25/22, 1:17 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Bayelsa is not accessible by road presently for about 2weeks now
10/25/22, 1:18 PM - +234 806 537 0692: But accessible by speed boat or by air ... Choppers
10/25/22, 1:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Well, if you live in this country you would know Preparedness is the last thing policy makers discuss and even if they do, implement in most cases
10/25/22, 1:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: So I dwelt on response
10/25/22, 1:18 PM - +234 806 537 0692: This message was deleted
10/25/22, 1:19 PM - +234 806 537 0692: There are still high grounds that are not covered by water
10/25/22, 1:19 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 🤷🏿‍♂️

Before even the floods happened tents everything o said could have been done

Victor you don't understand disaster management if you thought I meant setting up tanks, camps is after disaster sets in.
10/25/22, 1:19 PM - +234 806 537 0692: People are sleeping on the high ways, cow those places are still dry
10/25/22, 1:20 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Some good people around the high lands opened their schools for victims to come in and stay
10/25/22, 1:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: So 

We are back to my point
10/25/22, 1:20 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Some churches on dry lands have done same
10/25/22, 1:20 PM - +234 806 566 2895: <Media omitted>
10/25/22, 1:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Have you also factored the possibility that several warehouses. Where these supposed prepared materials were housed could have been submerged
10/25/22, 1:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We saw the Teaching hospital or FMC under water
10/25/22, 1:21 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The strategies I stated should have been in place before.

As water starts gathering evacuation starts. Even animals are evacuated in good countries
10/25/22, 1:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Smiles
10/25/22, 1:22 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 🙄🙄
Before it happened you knew now

Flood did not just fall on your head one day😂
10/25/22, 1:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Totally commendable and understood
10/25/22, 1:23 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Told you you're sounding like an apologist. Because you're grasping for straws to make a case for the government where there's none

The suck at preparedness and when your preparedness is terrible, then response is weak
10/25/22, 1:24 PM - +234 806 537 0692: The commissioners quarters was submerged and some of the were running to PH but had to return cos the roads were flooded .... They ran to hotels on high lands to stay
10/25/22, 1:24 PM - +234 806 566 2895: But for storey buildings, which aren't common in the Bayelsa, there'd be dead bodies littered all over
10/25/22, 1:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I agree and have said they suck at preparedness.
10/25/22, 1:25 PM - +234 703 714 8734: <Media omitted>
10/25/22, 1:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Can anybody talk about the state of the Central Medical Store so that we have some objectivity
10/25/22, 1:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Roland you are on the EOC team. You should have a status report
10/25/22, 1:26 PM - +234 806 537 0692: A litre of fuel is 1000 as t
at last week

Bayelsa people done farm and are quite lazy ... As at last week, no single onions could be found in the town


Small Indomie was being sold for 350naira, if you see it


Snakes have killed a number of people cos it has invaded their houses ..
10/25/22, 1:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Very sad too.
10/25/22, 1:26 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Story buildings ... The ground floor is inside water, so basically you have to stay up and have everything you need
10/25/22, 1:27 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Susan, outline your solutions to these already existing problems if you had all the resources at your disposal
10/25/22, 1:27 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Factoring in the realities of access routes and other means of transportation
10/25/22, 1:28 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Very pathetic state I must say
10/25/22, 1:29 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Here's something else that they aren't preparing for

Outbreaks from this flooding

-Cholera
-Lassa from rats running to avoid floods
-Monkeypox from overcrowding
-Meningitis
-Yellow fever
Etc

Vaccines need to be on hand
10/25/22, 1:29 PM - +234 806 566 2895: We have some supplies as Yenagoa was not as badly punished as other LGAs but access to communities needs to be better funded to provide robust integrated care

But various facilities, SDD, freezers are submerged
10/25/22, 1:31 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Lol

They're not lazy, there's barely land to farm that isn't under water or running over oil pipelines

They're fishermen

Over a hundred persons in a single compounded that's on high ground sharing food resources

They can't be anything left, as those with more with share with those with nothing before the floods
10/25/22, 1:32 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Government have access to air force and can get choppers to fly into Bayelsa to deliver relief materials ....

Speeds boats are also available at Naval posts in Rivers and CrossRivers and Akwa-Ibom states ... Get them to use to deliver supplies. Rent speed boats if you have to.

There are still some high grounds ... Set up IDP camps and admit people ... Provide basic needs for them .... Food, water, sleeping items, toilets 

Send out rescue teams, people are still trapped ... Have you seen the recent videos where fellow common men used rope to save a man who was trapped on a tree by the flood ... If common men can make these efforts ... Government can do much more!
10/25/22, 1:33 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Gbam!

The truth is the total of the government is so glaring
10/25/22, 1:34 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Rowlin dear, they are lazy ... I have been there, they believe alot in hand downs ... The few farms there are by people form Delta and Rivers ... Them get their own (I know)
10/25/22, 1:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Victor let me ask you a question, have you heard the government conduct SEARCH and RESCUE?😃

It's part of response

Tagging and evacuation of the dead,
10/25/22, 1:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Well, we can agree to disagree 😅

I believe people's agricultural pursuits large depend on the nature of arable land

They're mostly fishermen
10/25/22, 1:38 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Bros, the people fishing majorly in Bayelsa are from Delta and Rivers (na your people dey fish there ooo)

A typical Bayelsan is not interested but has a large entitlement mentality ... That one na discussion for another day....


E no too concern this flood matter ☺️☺️☺️
10/25/22, 1:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That's a great video
10/25/22, 1:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly Buhari's government is the luckiest in the world

Jonathan was sacked for less

Countries have gone to war with Buhari's style of leadership 

Yet after 8 years of failure we are still making excuses for him

Blaming victims of flood because they did not evacuate despite warning....as if the government made alternative place for them to go
10/25/22, 1:39 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Corpes have been washed up in many places ... The rate of diseases afterwards 😳😳😳😳
10/25/22, 1:40 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Lol

Babe I have been to the interior, worked there

Nembe, Ogbia, Brass, Southern Ijaw. E get why I dey tok but no wahala na flood matter we dey
10/25/22, 1:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: <Media omitted>
10/25/22, 1:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You would think he did not say this....until you watch the video
10/25/22, 1:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Your last paragraph is gold

God bless you

That thing was so irksome

The idiots think it's everyone that has stolen government money and can fly out or has two houses to evacuate

Telling people to evacuate, to where, government house
10/25/22, 1:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: In other news
Thunder fire this government 😑
10/25/22, 1:42 PM - +234 806 537 0692: 🥰🥰🥰
10/25/22, 1:42 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Amen
10/25/22, 1:43 PM - +234 817 034 1232: They are lucky the gods have  become merciful

10/25/22, 1:44 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Of course

That is why the top APC and PDP officials barely attack each other but would rather face Peter and Labour party
10/25/22, 1:45 PM - +234 806 537 0692: @14159348891, hope you have seen this
10/25/22, 1:47 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Some people dey live for building wey no get roof, others dey incomplete building wey dem use sack vloth cover window

Some live in chicken coops

Others have 4 children in one room apartment but you're telling them to evacuate, so you say later that you warned people

God go punish some people wallahi

It cost next to nothing to send, experts, navy, even local fishermen to evacuate people but you leave them to fend for themselves

If you die you die and you'd say we have a government

Even States are very dumb, you know the kind of FG you have and you still look up to them for help instead of preparing adequately
10/25/22, 1:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: <Media omitted>
10/25/22, 1:52 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol you are in the EOC, have you proposed and they denied you the resources for that?
10/25/22, 1:53 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: All brilliant ideas. And totally doable. I will still refer to the fact that government will take these decisions and actionable steps. But it’s the same middlemen Nigerians who will sabotage it. Case in point the number of foodstuff recovered from warehouses during Covid some even expiring
10/25/22, 1:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Nigerias problem isn’t entirely Govt. The average nIgerian takes advantage of disaster to move their own share of Govt resources
10/25/22, 1:57 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Like I said before, people already have done this without the government's aid

We have passed this phase
10/25/22, 2:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The government themselves are not free from blame. They prepare poorly, respond too late and at the heart of it is a lack of concern for persons being governed.

It's just a respect for humanity 

Apologist things wan gum you o😅, you're trying needlessly to exculpate them from blame
10/25/22, 2:01 PM - +234 806 566 2895: That failure of implementation is still a failure of leadership. When you give your brother contracts and he abdicates his responsibility, you're helpless
10/25/22, 2:02 PM - +234 806 566 2895: *lack of
10/25/22, 2:04 PM - +234 806 216 1419: Happy birthday man...... God's blessings always
10/25/22, 2:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Yes Susan seen.
10/25/22, 2:08 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: How many states can actually self sustain Roland. How many are viable without FG allocations. A large chunk of it goes to overhead cost because they don’t produce crap. Is it these same state that will tend to the sufferings of the very poor. This is the sad reality of our nation.
10/25/22, 2:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I will never be a Govt apologist. Too refined for that.
10/25/22, 2:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let me use an analogy to throw more light
10/25/22, 2:10 PM - +234 806 566 2895: You still don get it Victor

I asked you a question at the end of my post where I stated strategies

What did I state that was costly?

You can even say you evacuated people but you couldn't feed them and I'll say, "oh, good effort"

But at all, at all

Haba!
10/25/22, 2:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In the recent past have you noticed the number of stores that now have CCTV to record live theft yet the value of that preparation is lost cos they can’t or refuse to fund salary for someone to watch those screens and report real time
10/25/22, 2:12 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Our govts have novel and beautiful policies in documents on how to approach disaster. On paper and in principle grand. Practicability zero!! Or Near Zero. Basic reason? No accountability
10/25/22, 2:13 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In our climes we leave everything at the table of the Govt. Just like in Infection prevention and control where there is a personal level of prevention, people should also begin to take personal responsibility for their safety too if I can key into your statement that a flood is never sudden even tho I have a little reservation for that
10/25/22, 2:14 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Just like the cctv footages elicit reactionary actions, that’s how our Govt operates
10/25/22, 2:29 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This is a disappointing statement for one reason

People elect a government to protect and secure their lives. 
Peter Obi so eloquently put it, "the primary responsibility of government is to secure live and property"

People have been responsible for their safety for as long as we have existed in this country. 

Let me make this clearer. For instance, I can't expect the government to protect me from eating rotten food or sticking a knife through my eye. That's where personal responsibility comes in

A flood is a disaster. Here's the definition of a disaster so we are on the same page 

'Any sudden occurrence, destruction or disruption of life, property that EXCEEDS THE COPING CAPACITY of the indigent community, thereby necessitating or requiring external assistance'

The very definition of a flood as a disaster means it has exceeded the coping capacity, and the external help needed is the government.

I don't understand why and how you expect people to be personally responsible for their safety other than to accede to the government's preparedness and response plans. That's the personal responsibility of anyone in a disaster

Why even have a government going by your statement ?

We must train enough not only to retain but export and compete to be the best in the world. However, the teams decision to give Doctors loans to establish their local private practice and improve on the current health insurance to cover 100 million people is plausible.

Doctors in the diaspora can always take turns to consult or perform surgeries in Nigeria like he did in Anambra.

They only convert it back to naira one or two weeks to election

So if they re-introduce new naira notes it won't affect them

This move by CBN will further worsen inflation and bring naira closer to 1000 per dollar.

Like Pam said, the focus should be on improving the value of the naira.

You call to question why they have not shown us how the samples will look like.

They are likely to be printed outside rather than in the minting and printing company of Nigeria, which will mean more waste of public funds.

Hear Charles Novia:

Somehow, God is helping Peter Obi as he gradually moves nearer to Aso Rock in 2023. 

Many people might not understand what the breaking news today from the Central Bank of Nigeria is all about or the implications for the 2023 elections. Only the discerning will get it. 

According to the CBN, over 3 Trillion Naira is unbanked in Nigeria presently. That means many people have been hoarding the naira for the past six years in their homes and holes and water tanks and wherever.
 
The Black Marketeers, the Politicians and the kidnappers…the traders and the drug merchants… name it. All sorts of hoarding of the naira over the years.
 
What the CBN has done by announcing that new naira notes will come into circulation with new designs by December 15th, will shake the politicians especially. 

Those dishonest politicians who are planning to rig the 2023 elections with hoardings of naira notes are going to weep, wail and gnash their teeth from today. 

From December 15th, it would be too late for them to find billions of naira to execute vote buying under the new naira regime. To get such monies, they would have to go to the banks and the banks would never give huge sums in a fell swoop in two months juxtaposed with the hoarding these criminals have been carrying out in six years. 

The CBN has effectively knocked the political class out today and if there was a 60% chance from INEC that the BVAS would eliminate rigging in 2023, the CBN has just added another 20% to it. 

The PDP and APC will be mostly affected. 

The Man who doesn’t give shishi and wasn’t planning on spending shishi to win his votes will not be affected. 

It’s a bigger win for him today than yesterday.

10/29/22, 2:55 PM - +234 817 950 7218: So I guess the predominant rumor is that there was a plan for a massive terror attack in Abuja. 

Then the military will now step in and form an interim military government and some sort of coup

Elections will thus not hold

That everyone was in on it all the way to the top

That is the real reason the US packed their citizens to leave

No one knows the dynamics of a military government on the lives of locals and foreigners
10/29/22, 2:55 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Does this sound in any way plausible?
10/29/22, 2:58 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

When I say Buhari is aware of terrorism in Nigeria they will say its conspiracy theory

How many more confirmation do we need
10/29/22, 3:01 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The crook wants an Afghanistan styled government in Nigeria if possible 

This is why separation is better for everybody

Those who want to live in stone age should gather together....those who want progress and freedom should stay together with clear border demarcation
10/29/22, 3:06 PM - +234 817 950 7218: When the US starts evacuating it's citizens

It's not longer a bluff or creating panic

They have legitimate concerns of something very big happening

10/29/22, 4:13 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Parade them?
So that they will mention Buhari as the ring leader

Lol

Even bandits we don't see their faces but if it's from one part of the country we would see them paraded, including their families

*Did you notice we haven't heard anything about who planned Owo massacre, months after the apparently apprehended the culprits?*

People supporting Tinubu's ascent are dangerous individuals who should be viewed with suspicion in other spheres of life and activites

11/2/22, 4:49 AM - +234 806 092 4290: 😢When has US turned to Mecca or Jerusalem? See a defence Minister that could provide prison break alert. They should continue playing with lives of innocent Nigerians, even them will dine from the food that is served Nigeria.
Without terror alert from US, every Nigerian knows that he or she is under security threat
11/2/22, 4:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The defence minister knows what he is doing

11/2/22, 6:57 PM - +234 803 281 3842: EXPOSED:

1. A prominent Nigerian politician hoarded ₦500 Billion cash in his house because of the 2023 elections.

2. A flamboyant South South Governor hoarded ₦150 billion in his state Govt House because of the 2023 elections.

3. A North Central Governor, who refused to pay salaries for 11 months in his state, hoarded ₦130 billion because of the 2023 elections.

4. A former Governor who Stashed IDP's money during his time as Governor hoarded ₦80 billion to achieve his dream in the 2023 elections.

More reasons are coming, this is just part of them. So, support CBN to re-design our money to save the economy.

Nigeria 🇳🇬 Will Be Great Again!!!
11/2/22, 6:58 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Now, I honestly don't know what to believe about the motive of CBN 's currency redesign policy.
11/2/22, 7:09 PM - +234 706 656 2719: This @2348032813842 !



I pray EFCC should act on this looted funds .


These guys have Cos more damage to all of us .


I still want to appreciate this initiative by the government.


Crime is crime, irrespective of political or religious affliction, we are all suffering from the consequences .
11/2/22, 7:23 PM - +234 803 281 3842: The trust deficit in this government is huge and its difficult to believe them
11/2/22, 7:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Bros leave this prayer!! This move is belated and still a means of one set of politicians trying to outdo the others
11/2/22, 7:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: No genuine intentions to salvage the economy. The cycle will repeat. These monies will be rushed to banks and swapped for dollars raising the dollar rate
11/2/22, 7:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: When the new notes are produced they will simply swap dollars for it and be richer.
11/2/22, 7:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Remember they have cronies in the banks who will tell you there is no dollar but take dollar to Alhaji and Oga Kamoru and Chikwelus houses at their beck and call
11/2/22, 7:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The root of Nigerias problems I still maintain is the common man who aids Al these crimes
11/2/22, 7:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In my opinion Buhari approving this means he doesn’t at this point care whose Ox is gored. Whether PDP or APC
11/2/22, 7:53 PM - +234 706 656 2719: Guy be optimistic na , how will I leave prayers 😜


Even minister of Defence is making emphasis on prayers to our country from US .


Nigeria shall be great!
11/2/22, 7:56 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Buhari doesn't care for nobody..not his party,or the masses.
11/2/22, 10:26 PM - +234 817 034 1232: There is something with the financial system 

If all these cash allegedly found (allegedly because this government can lie anyway)

If you pump too many loots I.e these cash into the system it will cause inflation

Again these politicians or terrorists don't mind selling their naira to buy dollar at a ridiculous rate now...they can even offer to buy naira to dollar @ 1 dollar to 300 naira: afterall it's stolen money and they didn't work for it

Buhari's move is not impressive. Buhari does what favors Buhari
11/2/22, 10:26 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
11/2/22, 10:26 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Simple
11/2/22, 10:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: And in Economics money is supposed to act as a store of value

Another characteristic of money is that it should be scarce

So if most of these politicians or terrorists are hoarding most of the naira as alleged....then we shouldn't really be battling inflation and our naira should not be falling

We should be battling with deflation sef

Nigerian economics defies logic because we have criminals in power

This move by CBN is futile 
Every economist or those in financial world knows it. Emefiele knows too

They are just punishing Nigerians and i think they should continue since we have people at this stage still supporting Atiku and Tinubu and calling it right to political choice
11/3/22, 2:18 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You meant 3000, I guess
11/3/22, 2:24 AM - +234 817 034 1232: 300 fa
11/3/22, 2:28 AM - +234 806 092 4290: What's the logic. Now that they need the dollar to mop up their naira, how can they get 1 USD for N300?
11/3/22, 2:29 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Will give an example with this video below
11/3/22, 2:29 AM - +234 817 034 1232: <Media omitted>
11/3/22, 2:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: 3000 sorry
11/3/22, 2:36 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Ehnnnn.....you come dey confuse my confusion since 😃
11/3/22, 2:37 AM - +234 817 034 1232: They will sell the naira at 3000

Since the naira notes were manufactured in 19 years ago
11/3/22, 2:37 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Na sleep dey my body🤣🤣
11/3/22, 2:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: But this is wickedness 

How can you not use 200 naira notes for 19 years


There is even another video of the thieves returning 500 naira notes manufactured in 2007...15 years


Honestly at this stage Atiku or Tinubu should win

We deserve our leaders
11/3/22, 2:39 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I get. Catch some sleep abeg
11/3/22, 2:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Gbam
11/3/22, 2:40 AM - +234 806 092 4290: My brother, people are so heartless. Some have died and nobody knows where they buried the money
11/3/22, 2:41 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

So much waste
11/3/22, 2:41 AM - +234 817 034 1232: They should continue 

Something must give eventually
11/3/22, 3:13 AM - +234 903 277 5777: Happy Birthday lord Jireh
11/3/22, 4:43 AM - +234 909 679 4850: See this Instagram video by @kevinikeduba: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CkdTRxjoZQx/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet
11/3/22, 4:57 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Which one be this again? A movie on rapture?
11/3/22, 5:02 AM - +234 909 679 4850: E fit be movie...just got me laughing this morning 😂😂
11/3/22, 5:18 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Looks like a play. Probably church program dramatizing the ascension

Quite innovative I must add
11/3/22, 5:24 AM - +234 909 679 4850: I think so too 😂
11/3/22, 5:59 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Absolutely. You are right
11/3/22, 6:02 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I hope hez got boxers or shorts on tho.

11/5/22, 5:12 AM - +234 817 950 7218: A little complex but ultimately quite fascinating. Basically saying that we are interpreting the universe based on our senses and perception of reality, when in fact there could potentially be more complex things going on that we failed to see 

Implications for what exactly the universe is, implications for religion and the concept of God all lies within

one thing I always say is "do you think an ant is aware that it is in Nigeria?". it's realm of understanding is limited but because we have these 6sense we get so cocky to assumed that our realm of understanding is limitless but in reality it is. 

There is a lot more that we simply are unable to perceive or understand

https://iai.tv/articles/donald-hoffman-spacetime-is-not-fundamental-auid-2281
11/5/22, 6:26 AM - +234 703 613 6886: This reminds me of a joke about an employee who went to the funeral of his boss. By the time he got to the coffin ⚰️, he said, look boss, who is now thinking out of the box? 

Let's always pray to think out of the box 😂😂😂.
11/5/22, 6:33 AM - +234 806 939 9882: But truly who is now thinking out of the box🤣🤣🤣. 
Dark humour 🌚🌑
11/5/22, 6:34 AM - +234 703 613 6886: Now, let me read the article 😂
11/5/22, 10:00 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

A lot is beyond our scope

However we will continue to explore for the betterment of our society 

There is a lot we are unable to understand this is why the nightmare of religion is : another live in the universe shouldn't be discovered 

Because if another life exists elsewhere it will crack the foundation of their belief. It will bring to question if they (life elsewhere apart from earth)will be judged and if they will make heaven

There are trillions of solar systems in between them are numerous planet. So it's hubris to think we are that important in the grand scheme of things

There is nothing special about us humans. We just have larger brains compared to our body ratio which makes us have an edge over other animals


The supernatural simply is beyond our scope of understand. Nothing supernatural about it just that our understanding is limited

However those planning on supporting Tinubu and Atiku makes me believe the supernatural or magic or jazz or juju exists. This is beyond ordinary
11/5/22, 10:04 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup

Life elsewhere is pretty much a certainty

We just haven't found it yet but anyone who thinks otherwise just doesn't have enough information

Actually supporting Tinubu or Atiku is a strong argument towards jazz
11/5/22, 10:05 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Gbam

Lol @ strong argument
11/5/22, 10:09 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You like it or not, this limitations is a fact that there's a Supreme Being that controls the universe, who is God of All, but unfortunately, not to All. Evolution claims we originated from an atom, but who created the atom is still a misery to the scientists
11/5/22, 10:10 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Atom? 🤔
11/5/22, 10:17 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Yeah, apart from the theory of evolving from apes, the human is believed to be formed by chains of carbon atoms, the last tiny indivible elements
11/5/22, 10:18 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Was there evolution from apes?
11/5/22, 10:18 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Or we are said to be cousins to apes
11/5/22, 10:19 AM - +234 806 092 4290: According to science, right?
11/5/22, 10:20 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Not sure this was ever said by science actually
11/5/22, 10:22 AM - +234 806 092 4290: So how was human being formed according to science

But it is those suffering who have barely nothing that are busy working to ensure Tinubu or Atiku emerges winner

If this isn't a dark spell cast upon Nigerians I wonder what it is ?

One thing is apparent it takes witchcraft, wickedness and greed to support APC and PDP. 

This is no longer a case of ignorance. Because those supporting them are suffering and the indices are there staring at everyone
11/7/22, 8:09 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I tell you bruh, that's the weird thing about this election cycle. People who have the easiest exit strategies are clamoring for Peter Obi while those without one are doing BATIKU

11/7/22, 10:27 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Like one of the P2 brothers said. You work hard in school to graduate with no job, struggle to get a nice phone only to come to the social media space to defend those who put you in the precarious situation in the first place!

Honestly, I do not see what 70+ years olds have to offer a country with a median age of 18.

These politicians( Tinubu and Atiku care less about you and I)

Atiku spent 90 mins to watch Arsenal vs Chelsea and still had the time to tweet, yet did not have the time to interact with you and I via the platform . Tinubu was in Abuja attending a friend's birthday party while the debate was on. Then people who they care less about, will be selling their candidacy. How unfortunate!

If Buhari can be away, when the floods came and he is away again after the terror alert by the embassies to seek medical attention in a country whose PM will never seek medical help in another European state, then your guess is as good as mine.

Atiku and Tinubu is a mistake like Buhari, that Nigerians must never make in 2023.

Anybody here supporting Atiku or Tinubu, be sure they do not care or send you or your members of your family, if they did, you won't be the one canvassing for them, they would take the front seat to interact with Nigerians one on one!

Kwankwaso and Obi did well yesterday. But it boils down to who you can trust.

Kwankwaso made very false statements  and is a red flag!.

Obi still remains the man to save this ship from sinking. Like it or not without apologies to anyone, Peter Obi is our next president! by GODS Grace!

11/7/22, 10:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Obi should stop attending these meetings if the other two candidates will not come going forward
11/7/22, 10:58 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Why this is hard for people to understand beats me

Whatever money you make through these septuagenarians, all it takes is one kidnap and it's all lost
11/7/22, 11:29 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I think he should continue. His commitment is to Nigerians. And that commitment shouldn't be affected by the presence or absence of his competitors

But in 2023 they are the frontrunners and have positioned themselves as likely to win

These things call the credibility and impartiality of INEC into question

They invalid records were mostly in SE &SS, apparently the north was free of that but here we are
11/13/22, 8:16 PM - +234 803 755 0266: So I keep saying that the north can't be 3x a state these are what they do. So I hope they would be questioned

11/14/22, 1:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Mahmood is working for Atiku that is why he has confidence and he is silent 

He is the biggest obstacle to a credible president like Peter emerging 

We shouldn't be bothered about vote buying even though that is a problem on its own too

The INEC chaired by Mahmood is a major obstacle for free and fair election

11/14/22, 7:07 AM - +234 810 006 7926: So happy this is coming to the fore. Let's see how INEC responds to it. If the north claims to have more voters, why then do you add up the numbers with underage voters?. It appears to me, it may not really be as it seems.

We must press the neck of the INEC to do the right thing

History Beckons and I will not be Silent (Part 1)
 
 

Chukwuma Charles Soludo, CFR
 
 
My attention has been drawn to some of the tirades on social media following my frank response during an interview on Channels TV regarding the “investments” Mr. Peter Obi claimed to have made with Anambra state revenues. Sadly, several of the comments left the issue of the interview to probe or suggest motives, inferred from my response on “investment” that I am opposed to Peter Obi’s ambition and therefore committed a “crime” for which the punishment is internecine abuse and harassment even to my family. Some people even suggest that the gunmen who went to attack a checkpoint at my hometown on Saturday 12th November but were gunned down was part of the mob reaction. I used to think that for decent people, certain conducts are off-limits, and that in Anambra, politics is not warfare.
 

Of course, as a Christian, I know that telling the truth can be very costly, even suicidal. Our Lord and saviour was crucified simply for telling the truth the people did not want to hear. I promised that I won’t be the usual politician, and will not knowingly lie to the people. I am not an Angel but rather than knowingly repeat the same deceitful character that politicians are known for, I would leave public office. It is a vow I made to my God and to my family. Only God knows how many days I will be on this seat but whether I am on it or not I will always say it as it is--- knowing fully the suicidal consequences of telling the truth in a political arena, especially in a country where lying and deceit by politicians have become culture and celebrated as being “smart”.
 

Ideally, I should just have laughed off the infantile exuberances as many friends advised (I am used to this, having been in the ‘Arena’ for a while). I always re-read the quote “The Man in the Arena…” by President Theodore Roosevelt (1910) to remind myself of the burden of public office. Several well meaning Nigerians and Ndigbo called to advise that I should just ignore them. A respected Igbo elder-statesman who called, advised that I should just ignore what he described as “Peter Obi and his social media mob”. According to him, “everyone knows that he is going nowhere, but they are looking for who to blame”. After some 20 minutes of discussion, he advised that I should personally author a response— just for the records.
 

Everyone knows that I don’t follow the winds nor one to succumb to bullies, nor shy away from a good fight especially when weighty matters of principles and future of the people are involved. One lesson I learnt from my former boss and mentor, President Obasanjo, is never to be on the fence. I learnt that one must always take a stand: for better or for worse. I do so with every sense of humility, and leave history to judge. Most people have commended me for “tactfully avoiding being drawn into the Peter Obi issue” until now.  Since I am now being forced into the Arena on this matter, I have a duty and a right of reply, if only for the records, and to also give the social media mob something substantive to rant upon and rain their abuses for weeks. In this preliminary response, there are some things I will refrain from saying here because, in the end, February/March 2023 will come and go, and life will continue.
 

At the outset, let me state that this exhibition of desperation, intolerance and attempt to bully everyone who expresses the slightest of dissent is reprehensible. This is Hitler in the making. When the revered Arch Bishop Chukwuma stated that in Enugu State, they were not obedient, he was ferociously bullied on social media. Any dissent is tagged a saboteur or, in my case, it could be that I want to contest for president after office or that I am envious of Peter Obi. Soludo envious of Peter Obi? Totally laughable! But this is the same person I was asking to return to APGA in March 2022 and contest for president and yet envious or doesn’t want him to be president. This is madness! Seriously speaking, the obdurate attempt to muscle the republican Igbos to maintain the silence of the graveyard is antithetical to everything Igbo. It is not who we are. Insulting other ethnic groups and religions or denigrating others is certainly not the path to Aso Rock. If this is not checked, it may indeed endanger the future political and economic interests of the Igbos.
 

In his time, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the undisputed all time leader of the Igbos but he had his arch rivals and even independent candidates won landslide elections against his party, NCNC, in Igboland. Obafemi Awolowo had stiff opposition among the Yorubas while Ahmadu Bello had his share of opponents in the Northern region. Today, no one has accused Afenifere or other strong presidential candidates from the South West of being “anti Yoruba” because Tinubu is a frontrunner, nor has anyone accused Kwankwaso and several other Northern candidates of being “anti-North” for not supporting Atiku. As a full blooded republican Igboman and democrat, I reject this despotic intolerance.
 

Yes, I fully understand the anger of some urban and Diaspora youths and some Nigerians who are dissatisfied with the trajectory of the country or with the candidates of the major parties and wished other options. Not knowing much about others, some see Peter Obi as the contrast they wished for. I get the point. But this is a democracy: the minority will have their say, but the majority their way. Translating anger and social media agitation into political outcomes requires humongous work.
 

For full disclosure, let me state that Peter Obi and I are not just friends, we call ourselves “brothers”. But we have political differences: he left APGA for PDP after his tenure as Governor while I have remained in APGA since 2013. During the last two governorship elections in Anambra in 2017 and 2021, he led the PDP campaigns but APGA won landslide in both elections. By the way, in 2016, he visited and proposed that I defect to PDP and contest the 2017 election against the incumbent Willie Obiano, but I declined. After my victory in November 2021, he called to congratulate me as I did to him in 2010. That is the Anambra way: we fight fiercely during campaigns but share drinks at the next social events. After all, it was the great Zik of Africa who taught us that in politics, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies but only permanent interests.
 

We sat next to each other during the Emeka Anyaoku lecture at Nnamdi Azikiwe University on 8th March, 2022 and I made an offer for him to return to APGA and contest as its presidential candidate. Yes, I did. In my mind, it was time for Igbos to organize their region politically before stepping out to bargain power with other organized coalitions. On his part, he tried to convince me that he expected APC to unravel while PDP would be the “only one” standing. We debated and he proposed that we could meet later to discuss further. He attended my inauguration on March 17.  A few weeks later, he requested and I obliged him to use the Anambra State government house facility to launch his presidential bid under PDP.  I was surprised to read in the news later that he had defected to LP (a party with literally zero structure), thereby attempting to weaken the same PDP he saw as the saviour a few weeks earlier. He paid me a courtesy call as the presidential candidate of LP, and we had frank discussions.
 

During our meeting, I reminded him of my proposal to him to come and contest under APGA. More importantly, I told him (possibly to his surprise) that I did not make the proposal in the belief that he will win in 2023 but that it would give us the opportunity to get our people organized as a bargaining force, with him leading the effort since I was busy as Governor (my immediate predecessor, Willie Obiano had indicated to me that he was not disposed to contest an election). We noted that we were in opposing political parties and in response to my direct question as to how I might help him, he requested that I should just ensure a “level playing field” and let the people decide. In fidelity, my government has provided the atmosphere for him and his supporters to operate freely in Anambra without any molestation (compare with treatments to LP even in other South East states), and allowed his billboards which are, in many places, wrongly placed almost on the roads.  As a person, I have several shortcomings but being petty is not one of them. We have shown him tremendous goodwill—which he did not extend to the same Labour Party when he was Governor (Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, as LP governorship candidate in 2013 was denied the use of Ekwueme Square for his rallies).
 

Someone reminded me that a mob has no head and hence cannot reason. The same Peter Obi was one of those who told Ndigbo that APGA was the vehicle through which Igbos would organize to engage the rest of Nigeria politically. He was said to have sworn to Ojukwu and publicly that he would quit politics the day he leaves APGA. The rest is history. When he was the Vice-Presidential candidate under PDP in 2019, the emotive train then dubbed the ticket “the Igbo project”. As then chairman of planning and strategy committee of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, I cautioned for a more pragmatic approach but the emotive blaze of the time held sway. We were vindicated afterwards.
 

By the way, APGA is Nigeria’s third largest political party today (after APC and PDP, it is the only other party with a state governor and third largest presence at the National Assembly). And some people have the temerity to suggest that APGA’s candidate should “step down” for Peter Obi as the “Igbo candidate”. I wonder when Igbos met to choose a candidate. They even argue that afterall APGA supported President Jonathan and did not field a candidate then. Well, the fact as I was told was that no candidate showed interest under APGA then. Besides, APGA’s unwritten rule then was to support the party at the centre --- which, if we apply this time, should actually be APC. But we have our own candidate. Recall that all the political parties had their primaries during the same period. Once Peter Obi realized that he won’t get the presidential or vice-presidential ticket of PDP he ran to Labour Party (a political party known as a transit camp for aspirants who lost primaries in APC, PDP and APGA), and the chorus by a vociferous minority now is that LP has become the “Igbo project”, and the APGA candidate who emerged the same time as Peter Obi should “step down”. Ridiculous! Now I truly understand that a mob cannot reason.
 

When will Ndigbo understand and learn politics, especially of Nigeria? When Bola Ahmed Tinubu defied the political wind of the time and stood out as the “only man standing” in AD and later AC (before ACN) against a sitting president of Yoruba descent, no one accused him of being “anti-Yoruba”. Indeed, everyone recalls that both Tinubu and President Obasanjo disagreed politically, and probably still disagree—but none is being accused of being “anti- Yoruba”. Under Tinubu, the South West strategically organized under a different political party, the ACN and went into a formidable alliance that kicked out a sitting president (in Africa?), and that alliance is not broken yet. Igbos, in their frenzied Nzogbu nzogbu politics, have sadly found themselves in a political cul de sac. Tragic indeed! When will my people smell the morning coffee?
 

Let me now address the substance of my response during the interview, and I stand by what I said. On record, I doubt that any governor in Nigeria has paid as much tribute to his predecessors as I have done during campaigns and in office. I always said that ALL of them did well and to the best of their abilities. Yes, Peter Obi was governor for 8 years (2006 -2014) during a period of unprecedented oil boom and prosperity in Nigeria (Nigerian economy was growing at average of 6-8% per annum, and oil price was highest during this time). I have seen all kinds of funny comments and interpretations regarding what I said about the value of his “investments”. Some refer to SabMiller and bandy all kinds of figures as to how the investment of $12 million is now worth less than $3 million. Of course, there is room for legitimate debate about the logic or quality of the investments. For example, people might differ as to the propriety of using taxpayers money to promote a company in which one is a shareholder in the name of “investment”, or even whether so called “savings” are warranted when there were dozens of schools without roofs or classrooms, or local governments without access roads or hospitals without doctors/nurses. A Bishop recently publicly advised that I should please try to construct the “Ngige type of quality roads”, stating that the ones done by his successor (that is, Peter Obi) had washed off, while Ngige’s remained. I promised and we are delivering quality roads that Anambra has not seen before.
 

For sure, prudence in public resource management is desirable and we are opening new frontiers in that area. People will however differ as to whether saving money in the bank account is a KPI (key performance indicator) for a government where poverty is escalating except where its institutions for absorption are weak or where the government has no robust/big agenda for transformation. Governments exist to save lives, not to save money. We can debate and differ on this--- (by the way, I know when/how it is appropriate to “save” as I built Nigeria’s foreign reserves from $10 billion I inherited to all time $63 billion, and even after paying $12 billion to pay-off Nigeria’s external debt and going through unprecedented global financial crisis, I still left behind about $45 billion--- Go and verify!).
 

Funny, in the rabid frenzy to grab every straw, they cut a clip during our governorship debate where I was stating vital statistics and they claimed that I was “praising” Peter Obi then while committing a crime now by “criticising” him. Hahahaha! Well, it is true that I said during the debate that, according to National Bureau of Statistics, poverty in Anambra actually grew (from less than 25% in 2005) to about 53% under Peter Obi in 2010/2011 but fell under Willie Obiano to 14.78% in 2020. Yes, poverty more than doubled under Peter Obi and more than 50% of Ndi Anambra were in poverty under him. Go and verify! I am Governor, and sitting on privileged information which I will not want to use against a political opponent. But on matters of facts, I will always state same as is. As the saying goes, you can fool some of the people some of the time but never all the people all the time. Enough said for now!
 

Where do we go from here? I listened to my friend Gov El-Rufai on TV explaining why the northern governors decided that power should shift to the South. According to him, they asked themselves what would their founding fathers—Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa or Aminu Kano have done in the circumstance. Today, I ask my people, Ndigbo: do we ask what Azikiwe or M.I. Okpara or Akanu Ibiam would do in the present circumstance? I worry that Ndigbo as Nigeria’s foremost itinerant tribe and with the greatest stake in the Nigerian project does not yet have a strategy to engage Nigeria—politically! Every four years, we resurface with emotive Nzogbu Nzogbu political dance (“it is our turn dance” but without organization or strategy) and fizzle out afterwards while others work 24/7 strategizing and organizing.
 

Let’s be clear: Peter Obi knows that he can’t and won’t win. He knows the game he is playing, and we know too; and he knows that we know. The game he is playing is the main reason he didn’t return to APGA. The brutal truth (and some will say, God forbid) is that there are two persons/parties seriously contesting for president: the rest is exciting drama! That many Americans may not like the fact that Joe Biden (79 years) and Donald Trump (76 years) are two frontrunners for president in their parties does not remove the fact that if both of them emerge as candidates, definitely one of them will be president in 2024.
 

As my brother, I wish him well and even pray for him. I told him during his courtesy call that my prayer is that himself or Prof Umeadi of APGA would win, why not? That is from my heart, but I also told him that my head and facts on the ground led me to know that it’s probability is next to zero (what I cannot say before you, I won’t say behind you). So I already told him my opinion. Indeed, there is no credible pathway for him near the first two positions, and if care is not taken, he won’t even near the third position. Analysts tell him you don’t need “structure” to win. Fantasy! Of course, LP won governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun on social media and via phantom polls, while getting barely 2,000 votes on ground. Creating a credible third force for presidential election in Nigeria requires a totally different strategy and extreme hard work.
 

Of course, Peter Obi will get some votes, and may probably win in Anambra state--- as “home boy”. But Anambra is not Nigeria. If he likes, I can even campaign for him but that won’t change much. From internal state by state polling available to me, he was on course to get 25% in 5 states as at August this year. The latest polling shows that it is down to four states, and declining. Not even in Lagos state (supposed headquarters of urban youths) where Labour Party could not find candidates to contest for House of Reps or Senate. The polls also show that he is taking votes away mostly from PDP. Indeed, if I were Asiwaju Tinubu, I would even give Peter Obi money as someone heading one of the departments of his campaign because Obi is making Tinubu’s pathway to victory much easier by indirectly pulling down PDP. It is what it is!
 

The current fleeting frenzy, if not checked, will cost Ndigbo dearly for years. The South East has the lowest number of votes of any region, but it is also the only region where the presidential race might be a 4-way race (it is a two-way race in the other 5 regions) thereby ensuring that our votes won’t count in the making of the next president of Nigeria. Afterwards, we would start complaining that we don’t get “what we deserve” or cry of marginalization. During the 2019 presidential election, the five South East States were united for PDP but contributed merely 1.6 million votes to PDP which was about the votes that Kano state gave to Buhari. The emotions might run to heavens but politics-power is about cold calculations, organization and building alliances for power. In a democracy, it is a game of numbers. So far, I don’t see any of these--- and 2023 might again be a wasted opportunity for Ndigbo! What is our Plan B when Peter Obi loses in February 2023? Some people prefer that we should play the Ostrich while Peter Obi toys with the collective destiny of over 60 million Igbos. Yes, you pray that he wins, but what if he fails as he is certain to? The Bible says that my people perish for lack of knowledge. As the saying goes, only those who Plan can control the future. Ndigbo, wake up and smell the coffee!
 

What would Zik of Africa or M.I. Okpara do in this circumstance? Our founding fathers understood that in politics, you don’t get what you deserve but what you bargain/negotiate, and you negotiate with your organization and VOTES. Not social media militancy or bullying (where over 90% of actual voters are not on social media)! Our fathers built alliances with other major political parties in other regions (not with socio-cultural groups that don’t command any votes), and Ndigbo were in the reckoning in the first and second republics. After the elections, we will see how many votes any of the leaders of the socio-cultural groups will get for Peter Obi from their wards. Sometimes I even sense a conspiracy to nudge us on a path to nowhere thereby further pushing us into irrelevance, and I pray that I am wrong. Just my two cents!
 

It is not too late for Ohanaeze Ndigbo and progressive Igbo leaders to pre-emptively start charting a pragmatic future for Ndigbo in Nigeria after the elections.  Armchair social media analysts can have the luxury of fantasizing with wild speculations. Right or wrong, they earn their pay and with no consequences. For us as leaders, the lives of tens of millions are at stake. We have a historic duty to act and being silent or politically correct is not an option. For starters, Ohanaeze should study the report of my committee (planning and strategy) in 2019. It may still be relevant today. Second, Ndigbo should seriously study the MoU signed at the Yar’Adua Centre in 2010. The leader of Igbo Political Association, Chief Simon Okeke and our members are still there. Thirdly and for me, Ndigbo should strategize and bargain especially with the TWO candidates likely to be president on at least four central issues:
 

A) Lasting peace and security in the South East, including the release and engagement with Nnamdi Kanu.
 
B)South East Economic transformation agenda and the FGN’s Marshall Plan for the South East as promised since the end of the Civil War (the post war ‘reconstruction’). We appreciate the Second Niger Bridge and recent contract for MTN to reconstruct the Onitsha-Enugu expressway. But the rail-lines to the five state capitals, speedy access to the sea, highways linking South East to the North and South South, addressing our existential threat as gully erosion capital of Africa, Free Trade and Export Processing Zones, etc.
 
C) Restructuring Agenda for Nigeria that devolves powers/resources to the subnational entities and in which it would no longer matter where the President comes from.
 
D) Levelling the playing field for the unleashing of the private sector and the full participation of Ndigbo in the economic and governance space; etc.
 

To conclude, let me once again wish my brother Peter Obi good luck. He should have fun and enjoy the fleeting frenzy of the moment. But he must moderate the desperation as exhibited by his social media mob. There is a limit to propaganda. A mob action often reflects the character of its leader. No one has a monopoly of social media violence, and no one should play God. Life won’t end by February/March 2023. 

I hope that after February 2023, Peter Obi will return to APGA (the party that made him everything he is politically) as I offered him on 8th March, 2022 and begin the hard work, if he truly wants to be president of Nigeria. It won’t happen by desperately jumping from one party to another or by unleashing a social media mob on everyone who slightly disagrees with you. I decided to pen my views personally -- again for the records. On this, I don’t mind being a one man minority. As history beckons, my conscience and sense of duty to my people dictate that I should never be silent. I will happily accept the judgment of history for standing by the truth!
11/14/22, 6:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This guy is the master of sophistry

I bow for him lies...sweet, smooth talking liar... Gaddem!
11/14/22, 6:36 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It's hard to copy the prose when pictures are superimposed like this
11/14/22, 6:37 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Are you sure you want to go there? 😁

Because even if we don't vote Peter Obi, we won't be voting SDP
11/14/22, 6:43 PM - +234 806 675 1526: I do not understand what you mean by that. “We” as in you and who? Go where? 

I share a story here about an interesting response and you want to make it personal? 

Truth is I have shared this here because issues about Peter Obi have often raised heated arguments. This is one of those issues to fuel more discussions as it were. 

It is never and will never be personal. 

Besides, I can bet that Peter Obi would not stand side by side with my candidate in terms of capacity, competence and knowledge.
11/14/22, 6:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Its not personal Romey and its not that serious. But I find it rather interesting you haven't posted any of the news or even commented on Tinubu's drug allegations, the INEC debacle but a post by Soludo disparaging Obi suddenly shows up. I understand why though. But that's by the way, we can certainly have the discourse
11/14/22, 6:51 PM - +234 806 675 1526: I hope we all watched the arise town hall.
11/14/22, 6:51 PM - +234 806 675 1526: More town halls are coming
11/14/22, 6:52 PM - +234 806 675 1526: We would know whose candidate is better.
11/14/22, 6:52 PM - +234 806 675 1526: 2 more town halls to go.
11/14/22, 6:52 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Your candidate's capacity, competence and knowledge albeit unproven might be quite high, but it has not been tested. We have moved beyond sweet talking candidates who aim for the highest seat in the land without letting us see how they handle smaller positions. Integrity was a key determining factor in many peoples support for Peter Obi. In this area, nothing is known about your candidate
11/14/22, 6:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😃 Oh that we certainly do
11/14/22, 6:56 PM - +234 806 675 1526: As I have said earlier, we all know that most arguments here are decanted towards Peter Obi. That response from Soludo interested more and I thought to share it here. 

Tinubu and Atiku are irrelevant to me at this point. Their sins are out there for all to see and whoever wishes to continue supporting them, that’s their cup of coffee. 

Mine is to share what interests me the most.
11/14/22, 7:00 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Good to know.
11/14/22, 7:06 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Unfortunately This kind prayers no dey get answer now. Heaven is locked to such
11/14/22, 7:07 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Everybody has the right to support their candidate. I would rather support my party’s candidate as a preferred choice because of his agenda and confidence he has exuded so far. Within the party he has shown promise. As a business man he has been successful too. 

Peter Obi has got his own followership and sometimes I do not blame him when people feel differently about his candidature mostly as a result of his follwership and fans. I hope it pans out well for him in the end.
11/14/22, 7:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Well said. Other candidates may be excellent, such as yours but he's mostly an unproven commodity in public governance and a presidency is not a good place to begin driving lessons 

Like I say regularly, no one survives drowning in style. A drowning man is not graceful in his attempts to survive

We are fighting for our future and we can't be graceful in our desperation. Because make no mistake, we are desperate and so is the opposition

So we will apologize to all persons whose feelings and sensibilities are trampled by our boisterousness, when we win...till then na one love bruh

11/14/22, 11:01 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Yes please. Good thing we shall have a debate soon.

11/14/22, 11:05 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Toh

The debate go reveal a lot
11/14/22, 11:11 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Exactly. Atleast first debate has revealed quite a lot sha. Last week Sunday saw PDP, APC, LP and YPP or so.

Yesterday saw AAC, ADP, APGA and SDP. 

I suggest we rewatch all and analyze. 

Next week Kadaria Ahmed or so of NTA begins theirs. 

The same with Channels. 


I can’t wait for all these town halls and of course the final debate against the candidates themselves. 

Overconfidence Dey worry me.
11/14/22, 11:15 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think your principal did very well. I heard him speak and I was impressed. However, I think he should have learnt the robes by been governor of Ondo state and build on it. I would have loved to see how his ideas would turn Ondo state's potentials into a world beater.

I also wished, SDP, AAC etc all came together and fight on one front . There would have been so much they would have achieved if they teamed up with Peter Obi. 

SDP has been impressive 👍🏼
11/14/22, 11:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes. That audience must be created for all, but to be sincere, Only PO has the  sincerity, humility, frugality, mental toughness, ability to see a vision to reality, the experience( Anambra state was the toughest state to govern, and he had peace, such that there was no single successive bank robbery in the last years of his stewardship).

Only PO can is stubborn enough to take tough decisions, irrespective of whose ox is goored and fight corruption headlong. Of the rest, only  PO is committed to cut down the cost of governance( and this is why the politicians don't like him).

Talk is cheap. Only PO has convinced me he can walk the talk from his antecedents. Can't say same for the rest. Some have left so much to be desired.

The other candidates appear sound but have not been given an opportunity to serve in a public space. I can only judge you by your past, and trust you by your present been not any different from your past.
11/15/22, 12:12 AM - +234 806 529 3872: This is a very biased view by Soludo based on his  myopic believe that LP can't Win the Presidency because of lack of 'structure'.
He is quite entitled to his personal opinions!.

11/15/22, 4:00 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *Soludo and his misguided rant* 

Growing up with the elders from the southeast; they usually said: "Passing six is not passing sense". 

Passing six meant formal education – passing sense implied native wisdom. 

Meaning you can reach the highest point of education without having common sense when required. 

Soludo's recent outburst has proved this statement to be time tested and true. 

Every election cycle the professor becomes a man-child and throws emotional tantrums. 

A man who lies about poverty rate in Anambra to make a point is dangerous. 

Respected minister Okonjo Iweala once described Soludo as:
“an embittered loser in the Nigerian political space” who is “so derailed” to “commit intellectual harakiri by deliberately misquoting economic facts and maliciously turning statistics on their head to justify a hatchet job. 
“Soludo has shamelessly pandered to so many past leaders that Nigerians are asking one more time – what position is Soludo gunning for now?". 

“There is definitely an issue of character with Prof. Charles Soludo and his desperate search for power and relevance in Nigeria. Nigerians should therefore beware of so-called intellectuals without character and wisdom because this combination is fatal." 

From a prophetic perspective Soludo can be described as a man who consistently displays lack of introspection.
A brilliant but malicious dark hearted fellow. 
A man who seeks to extinguish many bright sun that rises from the east. 

The thought process of Soludo and a toddler becomes one every election season. A toddler can be overlooked for lack of experience.
But Soludo is a case study. 

He attacked Okonjo and Jonathan's economic policies on the run up to the election and the result was the emergence of Buhari a prime example of economic failure. 

Soludo in his article claimed to be a Christian but has clearly demonstrated lack of wisdom. 
He will be well adviced to read James 1: 5-6 – "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed." 

Every individual should strive to have a healthy dose of Intelligent quotient and emotional intelligence to perform properly in the society. 

We can only hope that Soludo learns.


The sayings of the prophet
11/15/22, 4:39 AM - +234 817 950 7218: @2348066751526 thanks very much for sharing that, if you didn't share it here u might have shared it myself

It was very long and I was finally able to read all of it late last night

The level of my disappointment with Soludo following that post has been soo massive. I have never really paid attention to him but always casually ASSUMED that he is probably intelligent and smart, I was excited by his prospects of becoming governor and felt he will do well


There are different levels to what appears to me like idiocy.

First, the fact that he felt the need to respond to social media reactions to his interview, when I first saw it on WhatsApp I was absolutely sure it was fake news until someone directed me to his official Facebook page where I found it was true

It was such a childish response. You are a big man, you are governor of a state and you had an interview, why do you feel the need to respond to social media banter in response. You should just look away and move on. His feeble attempt to rationalize why he was responding was unsatisfactory


Secondly, you say you want to set the record straight and then you start to basically insult Peter Obi and bring down the work he did in Anambra state. Peter Obi has not said or done anything, you did an interview, said something, people attacked you then you respond by attacking PO. 

How does that make sense? Why are you trying to attack a man who hasn't said anything against you? Talking "I have deliberately refused to speak since but now I have to wade in"

So with all the anger frm being attacked on social media this is your response



Thirdly, he has displayed what I had been told before. The post reeked of tribal politics and a tribal mindset. Soludo keeps trying to be an Igbo politician and play Igbo politics. That is very unappealing because increasingly we are embracing diversity. A good politician is a Nigerian politician not an Igbo one

You can try to look after the interest of your people but you can't come out publicly and be talking about Igbo interest and how to get your own turn and all that. His Igbo this and Igbo that personality will make him rooted to the east


Next, he has displayed his own political immaturity. He still has a potential second term but most likely he will lose that election unless he performs outstandingly well. And so far he hasn't done much I hear. Because how will you come and be attacking a loved Son of the soil. You are politically shooting yourself on the foot because you will instantly lose a lot of favour

Then about LP chances, he spoke with such childishness and bitterness and little sense of understanding human behaviour. It is favourable of course because for every politician who comes out to downplay LPs chances a fire burns In the eyes of the youths and more and more people become determined to prove them young. 

He was right in saying that in every region there will be opposition to a candidate from the same region

I have never expected him to support PO, he is an APGA man and I expect him to support APGA and pretend like their candidate is the best. 

Same way you @2348066751526 pretend like yours is the best. That's the right thing to do as a party man

But to come and intentionally start attacking PO, without any provocation from PO but because of your childish sensibilities and then you do so with such flimsy analysis and almost like someone in a secondary school debate

The SUBSTANCE (of lack of thereof) of the reply was the most disappointing part of it

If he gave a robust intelligent logical reply I'd have still held him to high regard

But this has been terribly disappointing and shameful
11/15/22, 4:42 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Pardon the typos. I don't proof read all these my long posts
11/15/22, 4:45 AM - +234 817 950 7218: You go to school in London and study social sciences and yet you still think you can predict human behaviour

These guys have no clue the power of social media

Shey its the same social media that had given him headache to quickly type this nonsense


That same social media go shock them for the election
11/15/22, 5:29 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Forgive me, but I just couldn't finish reading this..He lost me at the "he is not just a friend, but a brother "... you attack your brother with your "version of history " which irks bitterness and strong desire to discredit a man that has said nothing negative about you. A brother whose number you have on your phone ?.. the North has a better sense of what brotherhood is and it shows in the success they've had politically. I wish soludo well but it's just disappointing
11/15/22, 5:32 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Because e school for London

11/15/22, 5:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: How a 60 year old man will lie publicly and shamelessly is baffling 

An economist and a professor

And they say old age equates wisdom 

Even jokers and clowns become old too, so it's not surprising
11/15/22, 5:36 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Verified

Lol
11/15/22, 5:36 AM - +234 817 950 7218: He even used "Go and verify" in his post sef 🤣🤣🤣


I like your statement, even fools get old therefore old age cannot possibly equate to wisdom
11/15/22, 5:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: That part make me laugh🤣

11/15/22, 6:22 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That was when I stopped reading the post TBH

That he needed to make such a blatant lie was more than enough reason to stop reading the post. There are too many records to show HDI parameters improved during Peter Obi's tenure. That you need to lie speaks more about Soludo's character 

That's why I took umbrage to Arome posting it here, because it was obviously a smear article
11/15/22, 6:23 AM - +234 806 566 2895: He still thinks this is 2004 when Poyi was using Motorola and couldn't fact check😜
11/15/22, 7:17 AM - +234 806 675 1526: It is interesting how supporters of Peter Obi will go the whole hog to disapprove an opinion. In fact I am most impressed because almost every youth is now interested in politics of research and facts, ever digging and rummaging  through even well distilled and pristine information to fine the “pin” in the stack of straws. Interesting. 

This is one reason why I posted that here. Trust me @2348179507218 nobody would have guided that article here as it appeared to have casted aspersions on their beloved candidate. It may have in any case. 

It is good we are dissecting the very fabric of that harangue. 

The truth still remains that Peter Obi still has a very long way to go before February as this election has turned out to be a marathon rather than a 100m dash race. The momentum with which he came out is beginning to dim by the day and this may not be promising and encouraging to his supporters. 

In any case, I think Soludo overreacted just as you have opined Chiboi.
11/15/22, 7:36 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Momentum dimming? Hehehe

You just don't know where we are working 

We'll see I guess.

Go look up 'UpNorthAmbassadors' and Sola Kafinta on Twitter

Just these two handles will inform you about "dimming momentum" 😃

Dem go learn

For this election na only INEC we dey fear
11/15/22, 7:41 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I see Soludo's response as political steming from personal vendatta.

One it is to distract Nigerians and Obidients from the drug Saga of BAT. Just like BBN was brought in early to whittle the growing youth support for PO

Two, If Obi says go and verify, and the sitting gov is saying it is whot nothing. This gives the premise for APC and PDP to checkmate his morality claims.


I also think the Political Elites from the east don't like Obi. They never did in 2019, and not likely to change now. They can't come to terms that someone who they never enjoyed from his stinct as governor, all of a sudden has become the bride and pride of Nigerians.

When Obi becomes President, it will not be because the political elites from the east supported or canvassed for him, but it will because his Antecedents appealed to the West,SS NC, and other parts of the country where he will be getting more than 25%  of the votes cast.

Like Chinedu posited, his emotional intelligence left much to be desired. And like someone else submitted, the rants and jabs to the personality of Obi and his supporters was unnecessary.

To liken your own people  to Nazis and Hitler, for me is political suicide and an assassination attempt for his second term.

I watched his interview with Channels before the said statement and all I saw was an arrogant and proud man, who was dismissive and condescending each time Seun reffered him to Obis achievements.


Way forward, for me is to focus on the door to door campaigns while we make lemonades out of every lemon thrown at us.

Obi is the only one of the 18 who is seen to have proven integrity, and a character smear campaign by the Opposition, is expected.

The elections is a little over 3 months from now, so let's expect more. The world cup will take a month and b4 you know it February is here.

For this on the ground door to door campaigns must climax, for those in the diaspora, convincing family members and friends with funds for the support groups must continue.

Soludo has a lot on his plate. First he must surpass PO std, then grapple with insecurity and response from Anambrarians from heavy taxes.
11/15/22, 7:46 AM - +234 817 034 1232: How Hitler came into the discussion shows the man lacks discernment
11/15/22, 7:47 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I love the fact, that the supposed momentum is 'dwindling '. This gives us more room to work on the background giving the opposition a false belief, before hitting them hard!.

Don't be deceived, it appears so as a strategy not a weakness!
11/15/22, 7:47 AM - +234 817 034 1232: An economist who discredited an investment that brought dividends for Anambra should not be taken seriously anywhere
11/15/22, 7:54 AM - +234 810 006 7926: It was his last straw that broke the camel's back.

See Obidients are calm and patient. You can go through all this hardship and expect people not to be angry. If this same hardship experienced by the youths, occured in North Africa, an Arab spring would have erupted.

So politicians should not expect people who you have deprived for so long to be civil with you. You can't beat a child and expect the child not to cry!

Infact, the politicians should be happy they has been no uprising to the way they have mismanaged the economy.

Let's Just focus on getting INEC deliver our mandate. It's about the future of Nigeria, and Obi is the driver we have entrusted to take us to the promise land.
11/15/22, 7:58 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Your 5th paragraphs is exactly what will be and that's what scares the elites

The elites hate the fact that they can't take credit for Peter Obi's current status and he will be elected by the masses not by any governor or political stalwart's support, just the everyday man
11/15/22, 8:01 AM - +234 817 950 7218: https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/175796-okonjo-iweala-attacks-soludo-says-hes-nigerias-worst-cbn-governor-ever.html

Democracy hardly ever involves due diligence. Soludo has always been the same, if you read Okonji Iweala's reply you will see that this has always been him

Its a pity he slipped through the fingers and will now carry this bitterness and failed policies to Anambra state
11/15/22, 8:04 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yeah it slipped through the fingers

The guy wants to escape the work of good governance by talking nonsense anytime the opportunity rises
11/15/22, 8:04 AM - +234 817 034 1232: On point
11/15/22, 8:05 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I don't know if you guys remember the collapse of Nigeria's banking sector. So many banks folded and eventually others had to buy them over

Seems Soludo was actually a disaster as CBN governor and it was SLS that eventually came in to sort out the mess


Slowly we dey identify the substance and the chaff
11/15/22, 8:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yup I remember that

This beef has been like ong standing
11/15/22, 11:06 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True. I just hope Obi doesn't give a reply or rebuttal . Silence sometimes can be an answer.
11/15/22, 11:20 AM - +234 806 566 2895: He won't but LP did

My worry is that someone with medical training will certify him fit to rule..and another person with medical training will vote for someone with probable diagnosis of dementia to make all the top decisions that would after his life/country for the next 4-8years.
Whats the value of the medical training?..
11/15/22, 3:57 PM - +234 803 658 2567: ...and to think that this is just a tip of the iceburg

11/15/22, 3:59 PM - +234 803 658 2567: My point exactly and that's why I even started with "a few on this platform". 

So you see, the problem really isn't these clowns being "packaged" to rule,  but US. 

We are our own problem and that's on period.

11/17/22, 12:29 PM - +234 806 529 3872: Prof. Kalu Idika Kalu, Nigeria's former Minister of Finance Writes To Chukwuma Soludo:

“We noted  that we were in opposing political parties and in response to my direct question as to how I might help him, he requested that I should just ensure a “level playing field” and let the people decide” (Charles Chukwuma Soludo) 

After begging him to come to your party and collect the Presidential ticket and he refused, You then asked him how you can help him. 

He didn’t ask you to fund his campaign .

He didn’t ask you to campaign for him.

He didn’t ask you to hide his secret. 

He only asked you to ensure a level playing ground. 

This is exactly the character that has endeared millions of Nigerians to Mr. Peter Obi.

This is why your boss Olusegun obasanjo is behind him. 

This is why Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is behind him.

This is why Obiageli Oby Ezekwesili is behind him. 

This is why Pat Utomi is behind him. 

This is why the Afenifere, the oldest political organization headed by a 94 years old man is behind him. 

This is why the Northern Elders Forum is behind him. 

This is why the Middle Belt Forum is behind him. 

This is why the Southern Professionals are behind him. 

This is why Professor Uzodinma’s Alaigbo Development Foundation is behind him.

This why Ohaneze is behind him. 

This is why the Zana Goni led North East Elders for Peace and Development are Behind him. 

This is why the Prof Abdulkadir Mohammed Gummi led Coalition of Northern Elders For Peace & National Unity are behind him. 

This is why the Muhammed Gwadabe led Coalition for Arewa youths are behind him. 

This is why a billionaire northern youth from Borno state, Isaac Balami will come out and say “I have sold my majority stake in my aircraft hangar as well as my airline, to join my fellow Nigerians in the Obidient movement, just so I can more dedicatedly fight this struggle to rescue the soul of this great nation”

This is why northern Will chant Obi kererenke inside the bowels of Arewa house. 

This is why the revered Oba of Benin almost broke his official neutrality tradition by making very positive statements about Obi in his palace. 

This is why he receives standing ovations from the NBA to the ICAN Conferences, from churches to mosques, from the youths to the aged. 

He has spoken at Harvard. He has spoken at Oxford . Today he will be speaking at the president Lagos Business School. 

Saying the same things; I won’t steal a penny of public money . I had opportunity for 8years and I didn’t steal any. I had the opportunity to acquire l and I didn’t. I reduced the cost of governance and made sure nobody stole. I gave priority to education . I was number one in health care . I was number one in security. I won an award on critical infrastructure.
I left 50 million dollars each in three banks . I invested money in several companies. Nobody, including Soludo has been able to dispute these.

Hate him or love him, Peter Obi has become the new standard for public officers and political conduct in Africa.

There will always be counter revolutionaries in every revolution, but the revolution will come.

11/18/22, 1:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: @2348100067926 going to raise objection at Inec will be a waste time 

They will not do anything. These guys are criminals

When I said Mahmood should be removed weeks ago before this scandal broke out; you said we should give him a chance.

It was because of things like these we raised alarm.

Atiku won Buhari in 2019. He rigged him out.

That is why Buhari refused signing electoral act until he won.

Now Atiku has been promised 2023 election that is why he didn't pursue his mandate vehemently in 2019

His action was obvious. That  was why I said then it maybe difficult for South East or South West to clinch the presidency in 2023
11/18/22, 2:01 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Inec was able to find out double registration and gladly announced that the highest irregularities was in the South East and South South 

Despite the fact that SE/SS has the lowest number of voter registrations.

It wasn't a logical conclusion


Because if Northwest Northeast and Southwest has the highest number of voters on register....it only makes sense that the highest number of irregularities should come from there 

This is carefully orchestrated 


So Inec has the capacity to detect illegal voters in the South and quickly remove it.

But they are telling you @2348100067926 @2348065662895  and I to detect the the obvious scandal which is currently from the North.

That we should log into their website and report it. It is something that I will not do.
They are taking us for fools

Even if you report it....they will not clean it.

Even if they clean it...they can gladly sneak back the data 3 days to election

Evidence to prove this is below with these incidence👇🏽

And still be incharge of it during election

Anything short of this just know the election is rigged.

Except you outvote the machine 

Which means the voter turnout must be well above 50 at least before you even make headway

2019 voter turnout was 34.75

So it will not be easy

11/18/22, 8:31 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Let's report and escalate it. If after that the final list still contains the same underage voters and the number does not shrink then our fears can be confirmed.

At least for a first, Nigerians were able to access the register online and detect underage voters( which for me is hard evidence that can be used in courts). 

INEC has taken responsibility admitted some of her officials were complicit.

@2348170341232 we can only get the best out of every situation. Even if it is 10 names you see in your polling unit, make a claim and be on the lookout for the same names in the final list.

All our efforts must amount to something.

Is the INEC 100%, absolutely not. However, it might be the only Agency, that seems to be work in progress .

11/21/22, 3:45 AM - +234 817 950 7218: But I think the states selected overall where favourable to Obi and might not reflect the entire picture of Nigeria currently. His lead is not likely to be this large at this point
11/21/22, 3:48 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True

But I partly agree with poll for one reason: It placed Atiku ahead of Tinubu; as it should be😀
11/21/22, 3:51 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Oh yes, that is likely the case. 


I think Atiku is closer to Obi than the poll suggests because he's going to get a lot of those core northern votes and the poll didn't capture a lot of those
11/21/22, 3:52 AM - +234 817 950 7218: At this point with Tinubu becoming a public spectacle he is losing a lot of bus support outside his region

11/21/22, 8:25 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This election might not pan out as we think. You will be shocked Kwankwaso may dwindle Atiku's votes in the NW. Even the NE,.only Adamawa is sure for Atiku. Atiku's strength is Mainly Jigawa and one or two NW states. Kwankwaso is sure of Kano.

Atiku may even be 3rd in this election only because of kwankwaso

Obi is very likely to break into the NE .

11/21/22, 8:31 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Unlikely that Kwakwanso will dig in significantly. Northerners are not foolish. The masses might like Kwakwanso in Kano but they know their best bet at winning this election is through Atiku and they will give him significant support. 

They are still putting pressure on Kwakwanso to step down mostly because of Kano and Jigawa

I agree that Atiku can come third if Tinubu's elite northerners happen to deliver for him

But any of the top 3 can potentially win in the end

But a runoff is also possible
11/21/22, 8:32 AM - +234 806 329 9675: *WHY?*

11/21/22, 8:34 AM - +234 803 281 3842: The problem with polls is that they are from a subset of the population that doesn't always reflect the entire population.  The rural dwellers, who are very active during elections, do not usually get included in polls. Also, the impact of election violence, cancellation of votes etc won't be reflected in polls. 
The eventual results are often different from outcome of polls. That's why I tend to ignore them.
11/21/22, 8:39 AM - +234 817 950 7218: 🤣🤣
11/21/22, 8:40 AM - +234 903 277 5777: Happy Birthday yaron Garang. Excel in all your doings bro.
11/21/22, 8:46 AM - +234 810 006 7926: For personal reasons,.Kwankwaso won't step down for Atiku. I think the first ballot will say a lot about kwankwaso's rising profile.

1. The younger northerners in the NW prefer Kwankwaso to Atiku who is preferred by the elderly, unfortunately who are in the minority.

Also, people feel disappointed they voted Buhari based on religion and he failed and are careful to commit to anyone and hence make up a large pool of undecided voters who will make up their minds on the last day.

Again the administration of some LGAS in some Northern states have been taken over by bandits and people may not come out as we think.

Obi will get 50% or more in Kaduna and will get more than 35% in Kastina and Sokoto. Kano is Kwankwaso for the taking(80%). Atiku will take Jigawa(90%).

The influence of Northern elders on Kwankwaso might be defied for  personal reasons ( do not forget he didn't honour the Arewa forum).


I think we will have more numbers more than ever before of Nigerians coming out to vote. And the shock effect of this elections will be dumbfounding
11/21/22, 8:47 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True Sir, but I think this targetted the rural populace and it was face to face. Sample sz.2000.

11/21/22, 8:55 AM - +234 817 950 7218: 35% in Katsina? The way you are rolling out these numbers

Okay oh

Time will tell
11/21/22, 9:16 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Obi is slowly but surely making inroads in Kastina.

Basically it's a question of who comes in second in areas that not your strong hold. So if you come second is it by 25% or more. If your coming first and your eclipsing 95%, it starves your opponent of the 25% in your stronghold.

It's 3 months away and a long time .

Our prayers is that our efforts will climax and God will crown and establish the works of our hands 🙏Amen
11/21/22, 9:21 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Hmmm

Obi won't get 50% in Kaduna o. If he gets 40 to 45% it's a good showing 

35% is large for Katsina...if he gets that it signals a revolution and it means he will likely win b4 the election is concluded. If he can get 20 to 25% there he tried
11/21/22, 9:24 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Buhari's traditional voters will move to Atiku...although Kwankwaso will take some if he doesn't step down 

This will compensate for the votes Atiku will not get in the South

Tinubu is not heading anywhere 


This contest is between Atiku and Peter

11/21/22, 9:38 AM - +234 810 006 7926: That's what we are working on and hopefully will hit that mark! Southern Kaduna is a block vote and with in roads by Datti in Northern Kaduna, it is likely. Even if   we fall short of more than 50%. We will get a huge chunk of close to 50% the a key K states.

These are estimations that are gotten from feedbacks from the door to door campaigns. There is little you can reveal, but trust me these are conservative estimates. It might be more than we think. It also might be less, but not way off the expected Mark.

Obi will come first
Tinubu second
Atiku 3rd 
Kwankwaso 4th
11/21/22, 9:52 AM - +234 803 950 6634: Preferably Ceftriaxone + Clindamycin/cloxacillin

11/21/22, 10:00 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Fair point I see your points now concern Kaduna

But Atiku will get more votes than Tinubu...Will be surprised if Tinubu comes first or second...it means Nigerians are yet to learn lessons
11/21/22, 10:00 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes a run off is very likely and that is where allegiances will be formed and the pressure on who comes 3rd and 4 th will be profound.

Also who comes third and 4th by how much?

Whoever wins the run off will be by single majority of total votes cast in the second ballot.

Not likely he comes first. Even coming second is an estimation based on the states he may have strengths, but these states are beginning to reconsider their stance based on what they see him manifesting on TV as regards his mental capacity and health issues. And this will favour Obi greatly in the NC states of Kogi and Kwara and will favour Atiku in the NE states of Borno, Yobe.There is so much baggage for Tinubu and hurdles to cross. 


The aim is to be first with a wide margin enough to prevent a run off which you may not necessarily have control over.

So really,  for Nigerians its which candidate they will pick first for president and which candidate they will pick second, as this will influence the second ballot.

We hope to see a poll that will factor Nigerians second choice from the four for president, as this will be a pointer to the run off.

11/22/22, 6:55 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I took some time to watch this interview and my honest opinion is that Obi and Datti left a lot to be desired. The way they generalized responses about issues raised isn’t far from what the over averagely educated Nigerian will address it. This is probably why Kadaria kept on hammering on the How? 

I do support Obi and believe that his greatest asset might be the Political will to cause change. But like I have always said expectations will need to be managed.  All of the plans and dreams are lofty but he will need to include timelines to all of these solutions for laymen to properly follow. There is adequate room for saying what you will do in the first 100 days, first year, so on and so forth.  There is also ideal and realistic. I’d be more delighted if he is more pragmatic in his responses. Datti could have done better in the response on Asuu strike. Obi also didn’t not satisfy me with his response on Climate. While we are a signatory to global agreements, there is need to absolutely quantify our contributions to green house gases viz a viz that of the industrialized world. It is unrealistic to say we will become productive and not acknowledge that might have an impact on our Climate policy. 

Just a few of my thoughts on the move
11/22/22, 7:02 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The concern about revealing details and people shifting goal post is valid, but the people who want to hire need to be convinced that beyond integrity and a proper understanding of the problem, a systematic approach to solutions will be deployed and not the staccato reactionary approach to problem solving we have come to know. 
Additionally, referencing countries as example is good but the need to adapt that response to represent the differences in demography, political and historic ideologies and completely different conflicts of interest ranging from ethnicity to religion as well as the structure of governance here would be very useful.
11/22/22, 7:07 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Do we really want him to reveal details of how to tackle insecurity?


In a country where military personnels give out info to Boko haram and Isis due to ethno religious sentiments 

Even international mercenaries and communities noted this

That will be to idealistic because you want to satisfy intellectuals 

He should keep his security plans to himself as he is better than other candidates
11/22/22, 7:14 AM - +234 817 950 7218: 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾


There are certainly gaps, and these are the gaps that should be highlighted in ideal situation where Obi calibre will be contesting with Osinbajo and Sanusi Lamido Calibre

That's the Nigeria we want

But Obi competing with Atiku and Tinubu is a very easy decision for people to make

Regarding climate change, the last time he was asked, he said matter of factly that he doesn't know much about climate change and will hire experts. It's interesting that he even had a response this time

He has also changed views on power following more information. Now he focus was on distributing what we have generated and Kadaria mentioned how much it will cost and if he has done the math. He claimed to have but I had my doubts.

The current government that has managed to generate 12000kW knows that they should distribute it. It's the how and money to do so that is the issue

Of course he has a valid point in saying of the leakages and sharing stops there will be more money to achieve these things.

Removal of subsidy won't be so east either

However, overall, he's miles ahead of any of the leaders we have in this democracy except maybe OBJ and when a leader understands the problems, tried to find ways to solve it and intends to do so

That is an excellent feature

No other candidate suffers half the scrutiny of Obi

They are weighing him to access if he's an angel or a Messiah. He's human

I don't agree that he is not far from the rest

What did the rest say when they were campaigning years back. They will make N1 = $1 and they will fight corruption and all sorts of unrealistic claims and aims

He's very pragmatic and it's very very clear that he's the best for the job

But he's not an angel. 


He's not Jesus Christ
11/22/22, 7:19 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Climate change is an unnecessary distraction 

Africa as a whole contribute less than 4% of global emissions

Let those that contribute the remaining percentage discuss the topic often amongst themselves 

Climate change will happen regardless of any emission you reduce. It's a natural process. They know it but want to engage in virtue signalling
11/22/22, 7:26 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I agree

Climate change is a global discussion but in reality the role of Africa isn't much

Look at what is happening in Europe. With the Ukraine war and Russian gas. Western European countries done open coal again to get power. Because they don't want blackout

Just small inconvenience they don't want oh

Then we should now stagnate our growth and economy because we are trying to reduce climate change that we contribute little to no green house emissions?
11/22/22, 7:38 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Smiles, you have narrowed the observation to Security alone. This observation cuts across all issues he addressed. We are medics and I think even our training taught us to be systematic or stepwise in proffering solution. You can go deeper a little without clearly outlining the blue print of your strategies. Datti touched the surface when he talked about Govt not being complicit in security. A practical example should have been given with the list of sponsors of terrorism given by Dubai which wasn’t acted upon by government
11/22/22, 7:39 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: His response to the question of sacking CBN Gov was very contrasting to his stature about “if you don’t get the job done, you go”. It was a clear question of if you were president would you sack him
11/22/22, 7:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: How is this not an answer?

Will need clarification on this
11/22/22, 7:43 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Solid points. His response about subsidy too wasn’t on point as such. But overall he is at least responsive
11/22/22, 7:43 AM - +234 817 034 1232: But he said if people are gainfully employed insecurity will reduce


There is a reason terrorism is not flourishing in Qatar or Abu Dhabi but flourishing in Yemen Iraq etc
11/22/22, 7:44 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Valid points but he should have taken a stand with these key points
11/22/22, 7:45 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think you haven’t fully grasped my grouse. He has the ideas. How about break them down in stages. First year, second year so we know how to objectively assess your govt
11/22/22, 7:45 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We should be able to tell 2 years down the line the trajectory towards the set goals
11/22/22, 7:46 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Not that at year 4 you are still addressing the phase 1 of a set target
11/22/22, 7:48 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He was attending to barrage of questions within limited time

How do you want him to break it down in stages on each questions 


Maybe after Atiku and Tinubu answer theirs today and tomorrow we compare and contrast 


We are not looking for an idealistic candidate
11/22/22, 7:48 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Smiles. We might revisit your last statement 4 years from now. We are looking for a realistic candidate who is near idealistic
11/22/22, 7:49 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You must understand that what kills people is not as much as the incompetence of the leader, it is the continued promising of eldorado that remains elusive
11/22/22, 7:49 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: For instance Obi keeps hammering on the gold in the north and the vast lands
11/22/22, 7:50 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Tell us clearly that that resource is unlikely to be harnessed in the first year because you would be focusing on governance
11/22/22, 7:50 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Or the safest areas will be harnessed first while you try to secure other areas so it will happen synergistically
11/22/22, 7:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Datti Ahmed in contributing to questions about Subsidy almost shot them in the foot when he tried to say Security affects everyone but Not everyone drives cars completely assuming that the impact of subsidy removal and inflation would only affect car drivers
11/22/22, 7:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Obis plan to take high income communities more than low income is highly unrealistic.
11/22/22, 7:51 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Several countries have tried it and failed even the US
11/22/22, 7:52 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And that’s why the black communities are highly disadvantaged till today
11/22/22, 7:52 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I agree with his response there. Except he didn't have full information. CBN governor tenure has finished. He was appointed by Good luck. Buhari is extending it by 1 year

One thing you need to understand is that PO tries to avoid traps and definitive statements

He is rallying for votes and wouldn't want to isolate any group
11/22/22, 7:53 AM - +234 817 950 7218: But even US election debate no dey enter this kind detail Anyebebe
11/22/22, 7:54 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Even Obama no outline step by step like this Baba
11/22/22, 7:55 AM - +234 817 034 1232: I don't trust idealist 😀
11/22/22, 7:58 AM - +234 817 034 1232: You are looking for quick solutions 

Nothing can be harnessed within one year 

What he is talking about is the fertile lands of the North

You hear him comparing the North with Netherlands almost every time these issues come up


The kind of answers you are looking for I promise you that you will get it today....in the person of Okowa

Okowa will give you fine brilliant points in stages this evening but you can rest assured there will be zero implementation
11/22/22, 7:59 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Which is what Obi has said before. That all their manifestos will be similar

But who can you trust based on antecedents to deliver on promises made
11/22/22, 8:00 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly
11/22/22, 8:00 AM - +234 817 950 7218: It's very easy to write and cram sweet sweet documents

9 point agenda

Vision 2020

Etc

Stories that touch
11/22/22, 8:02 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 

There is a reason I am still a Trump supporter. Even though Anyebe will not like it😀
Because Vico likes fine talking Democratic points

Do I want trump as a close friend...Not really?
 Do I want him as a leader? Definitely Yes

We should be isolating characters of leaders from their capacity to deliver 

These are two different things
11/22/22, 8:05 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: All your points are valid. Everytime Obi gets up there he has a chance to sway the few middle class who are undecided cos they are already used to rhetorics. 
Secondly, this integrity thing remember was also a Major point for Buhari. Yet it hasn’t achieved the desired result. 

In essence what I am trying to say is as president, Obi cannot and will not sign every contract or procurement process even at federal level. That thing about if I don’t steal nobody will steal is gibberish. I thank God he has antecedents and was able to deliver at a state level. The diversity of interests at the federal level is totally different. This is why some people who did well at state have struggled at federal level
11/22/22, 8:07 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If on security you tell me for instance that in the first year you will harmonize all federal data bases, spend the money and get it done.I would score you high.
11/22/22, 8:08 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree 100% with you in everything but I realize why he didn't go into details.

If he was the last to be interviewed I'd be upset but APC and PDP, especially APC has been pilfering his comments and strategies, so I understand his reticence
11/22/22, 8:10 AM - +234 806 566 2895: This is true
It'll be hard to swing
11/22/22, 8:11 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Which people did well at state level and struggled at federal level?
11/22/22, 8:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Buhari and Peter Obi in one sentence? Haba

Did Buhari have antecedents concerning integrity in the first place?

That statement is not gibberish. If he doesn't steal you can't steal. He has proven this at state level

That is why house of reps members impeached him.

Buhari is crook so others at Federal agencies will loot. These things are not complex

Until we change this mindset the country will not move forward
11/22/22, 8:12 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's exactly what Anyebe is still missing. I understand him completely and I would prefer Peter Obi was more detailed but the difference between Anyebe and myself is that I understand why

Public Health makes one conduct a SWOT of every plan to know where there are pitfalls. But this is politics, if you tell people the truth too early, you're done
11/22/22, 8:14 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I just tire that comparison should never ever be made
11/22/22, 8:19 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly. You can exactly say it as it is

It's votes he wants not to scare people shitless
11/22/22, 8:35 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes brotherly

That he understands the convoluted nature of our society so well, to even know what not to say and what to say shows he'll make an excellent leader. Because see that mumu that was suggesting Peter Obi tried to assassinate Soludo's people, that one is just waiting for a reason to shout "hey, see Biafran" 

People think you have to move mountains to improve Nigeria, Lailai o

11/22/22, 9:41 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Vic I see your point but you can't get granular details from the way the interview went. There was no time at All to respond to the questions, Khadaria's style was unprofessional to me as you need to give some time for the person your interviewing to respond rather than interjecting them and when you see their hitting the nail on the head you hurriedly bring in another question for the excuse of want of time.

We have watched interviews by high-end news channels and we have seen how efficiently they manage time.

As regards security, he was spot on for not revealing granular details, however as he has often said, Technology, the best brains in charge, improving production and reducing criminality in the long run, synergy between security agencies, improved motivation of the men on the field and been the C- in -C would suffice.

His response was on the mark.
He is the only candidate who has not played politics with subsidy and said he will remove it from day 1, as it is an organised crime!.
11/22/22, 9:50 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Tell me any of the candidates who has said anything better than Obi on subsidy?. And it not just in the saying, how many has the capacity to implement it. How many know the granular details of how many ltrs we consume?, How

11/22/22, 11:27 AM - +234 810 006 7926: *Against All Odds a renaissance is birthed* 

When Obi left his private concerns to govern Anambra, which was at the time a theatre of War ruled by God father's and ritualists that patronized Okija shrine, he was told he could not win.


When he contested and lost, he was told 'we told you so'. He went to the courts for 3 years and he was told nobody has ever gotten his mandate from the courts, Never! The judiciary is compromised!

Alas he won!. As the only  gov who won from a minority party APGA in a region whose stronghold was the PDP. This was at a time election rigging was at its peak( you had a one on one with Maurice Iwu who presided over one of our worst elections. You can quote me on this!).

6-7 months into his administration, he was impeached by a house denonimated by PDP HA members, because he didn't bribe them or inflate contracts.

He went to courts, and was told no body has come back from impeachment!.

Alas he won only a few days after Ladoja was returned by the courts in Oyo. 


He went for a second term and was told no body since the creation of Anambra has been relected, He won, making him the first
 person in the history of Anambra to do so!.

We was impeached twice( first in history to do so) and went to courts and was told he would not be twice as lucky as it has never happened. He won!

He made history when his deputy who he chose on competence rather than political expedience, became the first female Governor in Nigeria, while he was impeached. Till date no state has made that mark!

Mid way to the completion of his term, he was told that by the constitution he had to step down, he went to courts for the interpretation as he had not completed 8 years of his second term. He won, making him the first in history to do so and made way for the off season elections. If he was not bold enough to go to the courts,  8 states today won't have their Guber elections off season( Osun,Bayelsa,Edo, Kogi,Imo etc)

When the run to 2023 began, it was posited ( even here by colleagues) he didn't stand a chance, as he was from a party with no structure. As we speak, he is leading in 95% percent of All polls by local and int. bodies and he has become the best of the top 4 contenders with the palpable fear for history repeating herself and creating an upset.

So as much as the dynamics at state level defer from the federal level, one constant that can never change is the political will, character, competence, boldness, emotional intelligence, humility, frugality, vision to defy every odd and make a difference.

This is such a shameless government

Their culpability is glaring

11/23/22, 11:13 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Definitely 

This was just an avenue to loot as usual
11/23/22, 11:16 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I still find it hard why Nigeria currency has Arabic
11/23/22, 11:16 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Arabic is a language and doe not relate to any religion
11/23/22, 11:16 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But I can't define what our link is to Arabic
11/23/22, 11:17 AM - +234 803 097 7516: English I understand is out colonial master language and we learn in school using English
11/23/22, 11:17 AM - +234 803 097 7516: If it's french we can understand, that our borders are french speaking and our currency may spill across our borders
11/23/22, 11:18 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But Arabic , can someone tell me please?

11/23/22, 11:34 AM - +234 803 692 8469: This was a valid argument that resulted in the change to our three major languages in the polymer notes.

I am sure when next these notes are redesigned the arabic inscriptions will be out. 

Now dem do only re-coloration🤣🤣
11/23/22, 11:36 AM - +234 706 656 2719: The re-colouration is also good  chief
11/23/22, 11:37 AM - +234 806 529 3872: Until we go up to 90-95% cashless, we will need to resign in another few years to come.
11/23/22, 11:37 AM - +234 803 692 8469: The arabic is simply using transliteration of hausa in arabic e.g “naira dari biyar” in arabic inscription.

The thing tire me too.
11/23/22, 11:44 AM - +234 817 950 7218: What is this? Let me just go and dip my money inside oil paint and I'm good to go

11/23/22, 12:01 PM - +234 803 692 8469: My thoughts;

Printing of money costs money.
I think probably changing the colour hue and saturation is cheaper to print than and entirely new design.

The probable aim of these is to make all naira hoarders to return the hoaded cash to the bank and subsequently make huge cash withdrawal difficult thereby strengthening the cashless policy.

Deceptive error was for them tagging it “naira re-design”.

11/23/22, 12:54 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Sir, it does have a profound religious undertone in Nigeria.
11/23/22, 12:54 PM - +234 703 985 5168: ... no thing more or less!
11/23/22, 12:54 PM - +234 703 985 5168: It not far-fetched. globally, Nigeria is believed to be the most religious nation on the planet earth.
11/23/22, 12:54 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Theologically, some scholars hold the view that is the language of God.

They can announce pure cashless straight up.
Ppl will eventually be forced to return their hoarded notes to the bank.
11/23/22, 1:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But that would be foolish
11/23/22, 1:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Arabic is a language
11/23/22, 1:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Syrian , Lebanese and Libyan Christians speak Arabic
11/23/22, 1:23 PM - +234 703 656 1230: But doesn't it make it harder to spot the fake????
11/23/22, 1:23 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Until invasion of Lebanon by Islam they were all Christians and they speak Arabic
11/23/22, 1:28 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Arabic is not the language of any religion.  Its the language of a region...
11/23/22, 1:28 PM - +234 803 281 3842: A region we are not part of
11/23/22, 1:29 PM - +234 806 092 4290: That's why it's absurd that we use it in Nigeria

11/23/22, 1:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: This administration wants to make sure we never forget them

Means if you give something to one set of people; you should give to another different set of people 

Basically preaching equity and fairness

11/24/22, 9:15 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Definitively no African country is likely to make it there
11/24/22, 9:16 PM - +234 806 092 4290: At least 1 will make it
11/25/22, 5:50 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Your beloved Ghana
11/25/22, 5:51 AM - +234 806 092 4290: It's possible. Even Senegal has a chance. They both played well without intimidation. They fought well
11/25/22, 5:54 AM - +234 706 647 6470: World cup is not about who fought well oh

It's about childhood conditioning with good nutrition that builds healthy brain cells and mind for critical thinking later on the pitch many years later.

It's about wise fighting.

Did you notice the African countries played with alot of energy and still lost.

Infact only Ghana could score world cup goals.
11/25/22, 5:56 AM - +234 817 034 1232: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
11/25/22, 5:58 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Wisdom would always intimidate Energy.

That's the fall back of playing well without intimidation
11/25/22, 6:10 AM - +234 817 034 1232: 👏🏼

You can see the future from the past.
11/25/22, 6:42 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Perhaps

Home grown players have tried their best.

Let's try Foreign grown players from child hood.

Get a good foreign grown African coach(also from childhood)

Let's prepare the players in foreign grown facilities(this may be expensive)

Then let's play

It may work

Just my thoughts though
11/25/22, 6:44 AM - +234 706 647 6470: I know Omale you are just wishing LUCK would happen and one African country would make past the round 2 so you come and mock me right?🤣

Why work on luck that you can't replicate?

11/25/22, 7:47 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I disagree. Not luck. Like yesterday, Ghana did not deserve to loose. If Chelsea can play the way these guys played yesterday with combination of zeal and skills, we will be in a better place in the league. These guys are doing well, just some poor decision makings. No goal scored yesterday was by luck. In fact, Portugal was fortunate to leave with the 3 points. With all the stars they have, in the last 20 minutes of the game, they were playing Ghana as if they were playing Brazil or Spain
11/25/22, 8:25 AM - +234 803 755 0266: Happy birthday Bukar and justice

11/25/22, 2:50 PM - +234 706 647 6470: What you call 'poor decision making ' that's exactly the part wisdom from good nutrition, environmental and genomic programming would have taken care of.

They were not fortunate oh. Sometimes the operation of wisdom look like you are fortunate.

When you don't work with wisdom, you always feel cheated because you may feel your strength should be rewarded.

11/27/22, 9:28 AM - +234 810 006 7926: PDP grounded Nigerian Airways and sacked Nigerians. APC never revived it, it tried to bring Ethiopian Air to Run Nigeria's national courier.

Over 30 private jets landed in Jos for the APC presidential Flag off in Jos, yet we don't have  national carrier to fly Nigerians, exposing them to the rigors of long haul flights with multiple stop overs and scrutiny. We have 10 planes inherited from the PDP and maintained by the APC serving the president and his VP. For a president who spent close to a year outside the shores of Nigeria, you ask if keeping 10 planes and it's attendant high maintenance costs is justifiable.

We don't have a national carrier, yet we have 10 planes serving one person( some National carriers of smaller countries have less than 10 planes). We have private jets serving politicians with public funds.

I trust PO, he will sell those planes and retain just one. 

It's high time we begin to love ourselves more as Nigerians. The politicians have loved themselves more at the expense of private citizens.

A country where politicians are richer than farmers, business men is keg of gun powder ticking to implode and auto destruct.

Being brown or colored is immaterial to reality

11/27/22, 3:37 PM - +234 817 034 1232: At a certain age you will realise that deviating of topic is tiring 

Had that strength over 10 years back 

Not now😊
11/27/22, 3:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol remind me the age again 🤣🤣🤣
11/27/22, 3:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I seem to forget so easily
11/27/22, 3:38 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay
11/27/22, 3:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You mean at 30s?
11/27/22, 3:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣🤣
11/27/22, 3:38 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Kai. You don't wish your brothers well.

Forget any curse that follows any Blackman. 

If you do the needful you will get max results.

Ghana narrowly missed the Semi's in 2010.

We must understand, that countries are investing in their leagues, feeder teams and coach recruitment. The Arabs have done this and reaping the benefits. The highest paying league at one point was in Asia.

They is nothing wrong with our skin. Senegal are the highest ranked African team in the world and even without Mane can't be ruled out.

West African teams have not invested in their leagues despite her talents ( Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory coast,.Mali, Guinea etc).

We have some catching up to do and until we run sports like a business, I'm afraid we will be expecting more than we have put in the years past and allude our failures to a curse or the black skin.

The Moroccan keeper was for me the man today. We unfortunately have not gotten a replacement for Enyeama
11/27/22, 3:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The simple thing Chibu needs to understand is that Morrocan are not white. And if he doesn't consider them black then he needs to acknowledge they are brown.
11/27/22, 3:40 PM - +234 817 034 1232: What Okopi said was true

The earlier we face it and buckle up the better

We just don't like truth. Well it's bitter 

When we get our acts right we can then form solidarity
11/27/22, 3:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Success has nothing to do with skin colour
11/27/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It is nothing but a stereotypic thinking
11/27/22, 3:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay
11/27/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Football is one thing out of many
11/27/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You need to have an open understanding and knowledge before you make sure statement
11/27/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: If France wins the world cup
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Would you say black man is cursed
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 85% of the team is black
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Who are the Brazilian
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Are they white
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Aren't those slaves from the shores of Africa
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't just press tour keypad just because na you buy phone
11/27/22, 3:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Say black man is cursed 🤣🤣
11/27/22, 3:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Success has Nothing to do with your skin. You can take this to the bank.
11/27/22, 3:45 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Otherwise France with black players or Germany with some black players or Brazil that had Pele with black skin won't win the world cup. Their black skin would have worked against the teams if your submission is correct
11/27/22, 3:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Two minister of trade met recently to discuss the trend of global trade and bilateral relations between the two countries. US and UK. Guess what, both ministers are black people, are Nigerians
11/27/22, 3:46 PM - +234 817 034 1232: This statement is unrelated to the discussion 


But if you guys insist it is related oya go and lift the world cup in Qatar🤣🤣
11/27/22, 3:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: It is like saying you are cursed just cos you didn't pass part 1 at first sitting
11/27/22, 3:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Isn't that narrow thinking
11/27/22, 3:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The black skin is cursed isn't it?
11/27/22, 3:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I gie up on this boy called Chibu
11/27/22, 3:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He need a better spiritualist
11/27/22, 3:48 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Yep

That you are cursed does not mean you will not find  something meaningful to do  na😀
11/27/22, 3:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Than the one managing his condition now
11/27/22, 3:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You need help finally I confirm
11/27/22, 3:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If you want an African team to win the world cup today, you would have made investments 20 yrs ago.

It is impossible to wishfully win a world cup
11/27/22, 3:49 PM - +234 806 566 2895: This whole mumu argument is rooted in the nature vs nurture argument and we know how that went

Arguing about how blacks are backward is not smart when you can several north American and European countries fielding largely black players in their teams

Why are they successful and African countries not successful?

Environment please

Let's dump this argument abeg
11/27/22, 3:49 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Original man was black(technically brown- coloured is rubbish because we are all coloured and the whites are actually yellow) 

He migrated to Europe and Asia etc and slowly over years became lighter and lighter

Those in North Africa where black and then the lighter ones came backwards recently and chased away the blacks and took over their land

So technically, the northern Africans are a more advanced form of the original black Africans and that is an argument towards their possible superiority
11/27/22, 3:50 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I'm not cursed Brother neither are you.

The premise of the argument is fractured.

Your skin or the 'curse' on the black skin, has nothing to do with success
11/27/22, 3:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Ayaf tired already jare
11/27/22, 3:51 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Something very straightforward 

That's why the blackman is still where he is

Arguing unnecessarily and in circles
11/27/22, 3:51 PM - +234 817 950 7218: An African team does not have the ability to organise itself to win

Blacks in Europe are giving instructions by the whites

They can thrive if guided

Physical attributes for sports are excellent

It's sense and organisation that is lacking
11/27/22, 3:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I don't understand you swiftness to take another stand which obviously isn't confirming your submission
11/27/22, 3:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Are you ok at all
11/27/22, 3:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 🤣🤣
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Pick a fight and stand bro
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Stop jumping here and there
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 817 034 1232: That brown colored talk is nonsense 

Just a different hue

Like we have navy blue sky blue royal blue

Brown
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Not environment

Sense

To organise themselves and play

Environment in Africa is very condusive for playing football
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Good so this has nothing to do with colour
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 803 097 7516: More of context based influence
11/27/22, 3:52 PM - +234 806 566 2895: All the athletes and NBA stars are blacks and are more successful than all white player nations

Leave this blacks are cursed thing
11/27/22, 3:53 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Exactly the argument. Don't say black is the Problem. It is ok to say context and structural issues
11/27/22, 3:53 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Western countries have invested for decades, have history, pride and you want to come and just win? 

How ?
11/27/22, 3:54 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Simple something 

You get strength to break it down 

No time. Not at this age.
Will soon start collecting pension😀
11/27/22, 3:54 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Sorry

I strongly suspect, without sound evidence that they races are not equal inherently

Some are physically strong, some are mentally stronger

There is a spectrum and some outliers

Unfortunately with human rights all research to prove this was destroyed and discouraged

Because if there is proof of one races superiority then a lot of issues can come up

But, there is a reason why Americans mathematics competitors are all Asians and Frances footballer are almost all black
11/27/22, 3:55 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly. Because blacks can dance, can play sports but can't think very well
11/27/22, 3:56 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Don't know about the can't think o
11/27/22, 3:56 PM - +234 817 950 7218: It's one of the most difficult things to acknowledge

Your own inferiority

Inherent inferiority to another group

But if you keep and open mind you'll see that it's very possible

We all know from medicine that the difference between the races isn't just skin colour
11/27/22, 3:58 PM - +234 803 097 7516: No one has said that difference between race is just colour bro. Now you are diverting. 

The problem was you generic statement based on your judgement of the outcome of world cup
11/27/22, 3:58 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
11/27/22, 3:59 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But another thing that flaws your argument is when other race are subjected to same condition as any they produce similar or better result
11/27/22, 3:59 PM - +234 803 097 7516: So ?
11/27/22, 4:00 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I said that in response to the often liberal human rights argument that we are all human and equal except for the colour of our skin

If we agree that there is more than skin colour

Then don't we think the difference might involve the brain? 🧠
11/27/22, 4:00 PM - +234 817 034 1232: White man is superior mentally 

Anybody not comfortable with that statement should go and cry and work on himself 

Same way black man is physically stronger 


But like Okopi said wisdom is stronger than strength 

Once you Identify your weakness work on it and you will match up

There is a reason the current heavy weight boxing champions are Whites...they worked on their weakness. This is supposed to be a blackmans turf

There is a reason Ben Carson a blackman first spearheaded the ground breaking surgery 


If you cannot work on yourself others will pass you....especially if they have the natural advantage from birth
11/27/22, 4:00 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Definitely but read the other part of my submission.
11/27/22, 4:01 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I have seen lot of dull white people
11/27/22, 4:01 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Personally I feel what makes human brain different is the environment. What happens to us in the first 5 years of life matters
11/27/22, 4:01 PM - +234 803 097 7516: A whole lot
11/27/22, 4:02 PM - +234 803 097 7516: How our brain is stimulated to grow means a lot.
11/27/22, 4:02 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Yes. There is a spectrum and many factors

So in that spectrum, the median intellect for blacks will be lower than for whites

However, the smartest black will be smarter that upto half the white

And the fullest white will be duller than lots of blacks
11/27/22, 4:02 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This doesn't happen in our society. Brain stimulation has a thing with problem solving ability
11/27/22, 4:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: See ehn.

Anything that led us to have white skin black skin

Curly hair short hair

Pointed nose flat nose

Those genetics equally affects the brains...no matter how marginal

All these human rights talk will not change anything 


Acknowledge your inferior aspect work on it and excel...Acknowledge your strength and take advantage too
11/27/22, 4:03 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And just to let you know. Even the white people think the Chinese are smarter people now
11/27/22, 4:03 PM - +234 803 097 7516: So ?
11/27/22, 4:04 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I can't invalidate the logic of this argument

It makes sense, studies to prove this would have been nice

Of course the Asians and whites had environments that stimulated them historically perhaps that was helpful
11/27/22, 4:04 PM - +234 803 097 7516: They look up to the Japanese and Indian for solutions lately
11/27/22, 4:04 PM - +234 806 566 2895: There's no unbiased data to support this assertion Chibu

Studies particularly twin studies have shown the different to be due to nurture.
11/27/22, 4:05 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I agree

I rank people as 

Asians

Caucasians

Middle easterners

Brown(mixed ie south American)

Blacks (African)

Aboriginals
11/27/22, 4:05 PM - +234 803 097 7516: I will drop middle easterner to Latinos
11/27/22, 4:06 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Middle easterner are not problem solvers
11/27/22, 4:06 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I'm actually not sure about it
11/27/22, 4:06 PM - +234 806 566 2895: No research o
11/27/22, 4:06 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Let me type a long theory
11/27/22, 4:06 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Median that's the keyword

How they don't understand it is a spectrum beats imagination honestly
11/27/22, 4:06 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's just a matter of time Chinedu. If we have forthright leadership in our FA, the right investment in our local leagues, coaching, Academies, an African team has all it takes to win a world cup in the nearest future.

We need to put our money where our mouth is.

Orji Uzoh invested in the then Eyimba and against All odds won the Champions league twice. And that team gave us Enyeama, and a very formidable defender for the SE. If we have investment in our sports and organization run clubs as a business, it will only be a matter of time. Take a look at what is happening at Beyond limits Academy and Remo Stars. The buisness owner is doing very well and it only a matter of time.
11/27/22, 4:07 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Just based on a cross section of all of these race u have worked with and working in their region and loving in one. I will sure that as my simple sample size of you allow me
11/27/22, 4:07 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

Produce studies so that the Liberals and human right will fight you with cancel culture
11/27/22, 4:08 PM - +234 810 006 7926: To corroborate your submission
11/27/22, 4:13 PM - +234 817 950 7218: So what I believe happened is this

We all know that genes change slightly from parents to children. And those slight changes in genes gives the children certain qualities which may or may not be useful to their survival

Remember survival of the fittest has been key

Now humans were first found in Africa about 70,000 years ago

For starters the more curious ones where the ones more likely to begin migration

As they migrated through Europe and Asia they met certain harsh conditions and the smarter ones who were able to survive, stay warm, find food in snow, cope with earthquakes and harsh conditions survived and reproduced whilst the dull ones will be slowly dying off. Of course melanin and dark skin was also none essential and so this happening generation after generation led to general smarter people surviving and reproducing and duller ones dying off or having little to no offspring

Now, for those who stayed back, they were less curious and more likely to follow cultural norms. Africa had little disaster, climate was condusive and food was available all year round

So those who survived and reproduced where those who had the strength to run away from animals and chase down others and kill to feed. Also those who could dance where also more likely to reproduce

So after thousands of years we had more of stronger and duller people surviving and thriving because thinking wasn't essential for survival or reproduction

So it's not a curse

It's just essential survival traits transfering from generation to generation

We all have a common ancestor and started the same

Of course, on the plus side, now that we have found each other again. In the next 5 thousand years at most we'll all be the same colour
11/27/22, 4:14 PM - +234 817 034 1232: All these genetics affected every part our body

Including our blood stream

But e reach brain...it did not affect it. 

Because we want to feel good about ourselves 

This must be a joke

Lol
11/27/22, 4:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I don't think this exists in reality. God created All races equally. Even if a ranking system exists, it is purely academic.
Nigerians are the smartest of the minorities in the US, far ahead of the Asians.  I work with people of these races and I honestly don't think they are more intelligent.

However these guys have gotten their leadership right and have put systems in place.
11/27/22, 4:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: https://twitter.com/Beyond_LimitsFA/status/1588903900102668291?t=eUO1HeW3q49aJV2vNrM2RQ&s=08

Which might in itself be a sign of inferiority. Because whilst others learn what is necessary and get to work

Nigerians just keep reading book. Everyone wants masters and PhD without even knowing what they want to do with it
11/27/22, 4:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Nigerians are even more educated or smarter than native Americans

You posted that Nigerians are the most educated and successful

You didn't post anything about them being smarter

You don't abuse power by using your office which does not exist by the constitution to arrest your critic without first pressing charges or suing him to court?. When did the spy police concern themselves in civil affairs?

She has made him more popular than herself.

What she did may create an uprising among the youths in the north. If not in the streets at least in their minds. Oppression  is abhored.

Now you will always have critics, Obasanjo, Good luck, Buhari et all are about the most criticized presidents Alive and I think tried their best to manage the situation with little or no human right abuses

So he clearly deserves what is happening since he is protesting against Aisha.

Secondly you can't support Buhari twice and be crying out for justice. 
No! That is not acceptable😀

Aisha should continue.

It will help him, at least he has displayed mental and physical Superiority over Tinubu and that will help him in the North

Kwankwanso fared much better this time. Displaying superiority over Atiku and most of the typical politicians, he has good ideas on almost all issues

Peter Obi did well as well, though displaying some weakness in terms of understanding how the government works practically and sometimes spoke a little too vaguely

They all did woefully in terms of understanding health sector and how to solve the problems. From funding, to brain drain, to solutions. All seem very I'll equipped to handle the healthcare issues

However, for me granting 133 million Nigerians access to health via revamping NHIS as canvassed by Obi for me is key. We can learn a thing or two from the NHS and discard her drawbacks. Also his implementing the National Health Act as signed by Jonathan is exemplary. Also   impressive  his whole manifesto is hinged on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by WHO

Snippets of PO On health as captured in his manifesto:

We will provide health insurance cover to 133 million poorest Nigerians 
including pregnant women, children, the aged and the disabled. This shall be 
without discrimination by socio-economic status in line with constitutional 
provisions as captured in Chapter 2 Section 17 (3)(d) of our constitution.

The NHIS shall be strengthened in an efficient manner to stimulate private 
sector-driven health provision driven by accessibility and affordability to cover 
informal sector workers, the weak and the vulnerable.
VIII. We will strive to honour Nigeria’s commitment pursuant to the 2001 
African Union Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other related 
Infectious Diseases, which set the target of allocating at least 15 percent of 
annual budgets to the improvement of the health sector in African countries.
IX. We will put to an end the financial resources-depleting practice of medical 
tourism, by supporting national teaching hospitals to specialize in niche areas of 
medicine, thus enjoying expeditious faculty and facilities enhancement and the 
attendant comparative advantage. We will implement the National Health Act 
of 2014 to the letter, and enforce the provision of its Section 46. This will be 
followed with further actions to improve the quality and service delivery of our 
health care system as follows: 
a. Strengthening the leadership, coordination and integration of the health 
system, while simultaneously improving its regulation, standardisation and 
quality of service; 
b. Comprehensive mapping of Nigeria’s healthcare system occupational 
categories to generate relevant data on human capacity and resources for 
healthcare training, with a view to reversing brain drain and stopping medical 
tourism while tapping into our huge Diaspora capacity in healthcare.
c. Effective overhaul and restructuring of training for all cadre of healthcare 
system providers.
d. Stepwise scaling up of the healthcare system budget in line with Abuja 
Declaration, while devolving PHC Funding directly to a revamped National 
Primary Healthcare Agency. 
e. Increase NHIS uptake, with a robust healthcare insurance scheme at the 
basic healthcare level with a goal to provide cover for the 133 million poorest 
Nigerians including pregnant women, children, elderly and people living with 
disabilities. 
f. Generate innovative healthcare financing by encouraging public private 
healthcare sector initiatives, implementing special taxes and duty waivers. 
This will include special incentives to encourage the domestic production of 
pharmaceuticals, drugs, vaccines and medical consumables. The incentives 
shall also be targeted at boosting research and development in the 
healthcare system, together with their commercialisation within a process 
that will be carefully audited, monitored, and evaluated.
12/5/22, 4:18 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Another highlight for me is his plan to criminalize owing salaries at all levels( private, public- LGA, state and federal) by sponsoring an executive bill. This may to some extent retain a critical mass of health workers back in the country, while the numbers are shored up.

His plan on Salaries:
His plans for salary / minimum wage.

Resolve the national minimum wage problem by doing away with the extant 
salary structure and introducing an hourly productivity-based national
minimum rate, by which public and private sector employers should pay 
employees based on their actual productivity. We will drive the legislation to 
retain a National Minimum Wage with a binding effect and application across all the States and Local Governments of Nigeria. This shall include the
criminalisation of non-payment of salaries, wages, pensions, entitlements, 
benefits, and violation of collective bargaining agreements. This will reduce 
poverty and inequality, and enhance social solidarity necessary for a
development bargain
12/5/22, 4:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: If this scales the House, we are likely to see an  end to strikes in the essential services as provided by public civil servants in Nigeria and may garantee more pay if Nigerians earn per hour rather than per month

12/5/22, 4:36 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It appears Reno is supporting Tinubu in this video 🤷🏼‍♂️
12/5/22, 4:40 PM - +234 806 092 4290: No, there are two groups there: one campaigning for and one against. He is one of the later
12/5/22, 4:55 PM - +234 817 950 7218: If I'm to be honest all these just sound like talk

POs main selling point is that he is sharp, reliable and will be focused on getting extra revenue.

His strong point is economics and hopefully he can assemble a team with people able to solve other problems

This that you pasted as well as what he said leaves a lot to be desired

How will you cover 133 million Nigerians in health insurance? Is it that easy?

People have battled repeatedly to find ways to increase the coverage. Presently it's mostly government workers because they can deduct from source and put into the scheme

You can't easily get farmers and people selling corn on the street to contribute

Observing healthcare in public sector of course you should know we don't have enough money to run NHS type of setting and we also don't have enough public efficiency to run it. Even if we had the money

The best idea I have head for health insurance is use of telephone subscription

Example, for everyone N100 recharged to your phone, N1 goes into the mandatory insurance scheme

This system sounded lovely and can possibly pull in a very large chunk of our population into health insurance

I always say that what we lack is ideas, but people keep talking about more money and more money

If you don't have ideas, money will never be enough
12/5/22, 4:56 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I think in education and health PO lacked ideas, he repeatedly said invest more, invest more but there isn't that much more money to invest

We are servicing debt and all that

His overall plan is great, but the specifics can be better
12/5/22, 4:57 PM - +234 817 950 7218: There's no need to become a blind follower

Everyone has issues, PO is head and shoulders over the rest

But we shouldn't just blinding take everything he says and act like all is perfect

We need to maintain our identities and individual reasoning
12/5/22, 5:05 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Okay
12/5/22, 5:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The question of where he will get the  money  does not arise. This is how,For health insurance, it is contributory, The FG will contribute, same for the private sector( especially the informal sector).

Once you have personal contributions and the private and public employers of labour contributing, it's very easy.

If the morbidity rate is c.a.30% to 40%=and out of 100 Nigerians only about 30 to 40 take ill per time, 60 pple are contributing to the total mix. 

With health insurance the  premium is shared so is the risk, so PO will not be contributing 100% as captured by your fears!

Unlike Buhari who many fell for without querying his antecedents even when it was obvious, Obi is planning to do what he has done before, so Nigerians don't have a problem to trusting him to do what he says and to say what he will do!.

I'm happy about your idea of pooling the informal sector as this  has been canvassed for many years now, We even discussed this on the sidelines of the National Health Summit that held in Abj sometime back!.

I'm happy with your idea on Phone subscription, however they are other novel ideas like making a direct debit of 100 naira out of your account every month. There are other ideas of pooling so much funds, just from VAT for non essential items and services. 

There are less than 500 k federal civil servants in the country and by the time you add the states and LGA, is less than 5 million Nigerians who can access the NHIS.

However this is where the private sector and informal sectors come in and this will be the new drive.

I like the fact Obi may be underated on his capacity to actualise his lofty plans, but I trust him and I trust the God he serves, and moreso the oil over his head.

He was underated in Anambra and was asked where he will get the monies from, yet with 500 billion accruals in 8 years he achieved what others did not do with trillions and made history by saving 75 billion
12/5/22, 5:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Never, unlike Buhari, such mistakes cannot be made. We are to enlightened, sophisticated and have suffered enough to follow any leader blindly
12/5/22, 5:33 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The only issue that has not been spelt out is the plan for emergency services.

This should be provided free by both Private and public facilities without a deposit and should be covered and paid by NHIS.

Maybe virtual meetings with him will enable us have this spelt out. If Obi must succeed in health Emergency services must be free
12/5/22, 5:36 PM - +234 810 006 7926: * recharge
12/5/22, 5:41 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Spot on if you have ideas without money, your plans will be dead on arrival. However if you have ideas, and moreso, ideas to make money to actualise your ideas, then you are the man to beat 

Obi is both, his ideas on health is spot on and his economics to shore up more resources to actualise his ideas, is the icing on the cake
12/5/22, 5:44 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Who is private sector please? How will private sector contribute for a farmer and woman selling corn

My suggestion is that you ask public health physicians about the challenges of health cover

Health care is not cheap and is not a charity either

This your explanation doesn't hold water
12/5/22, 5:47 PM - +234 806 675 1526: PO wasn’t impressive at the presidential town hall by arise.
12/5/22, 5:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: All these sectors you are talking about are unspecific

Who is informal sector? In his interview yesterday he didn't even identify these issues

He just said he will invest more

When asked about brain drain, he said be training plenty people

How will you be training and exporting?

You need to assess why people are leaving and know that job opportunities, security and the economy are the major push factors

Once these stop the brain drain will reduce

Like I said PO is the best candidate

But his analysis on health wasn't satisfactory to me
12/5/22, 5:48 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Atiku was more articulate than the rest. He focused more on the issues raised as spoke more president-like.
12/5/22, 5:50 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Please watch out for the candidate of the social Democratic Party when he appears there. I trust him to be very articulate with his points. Trust him to deliver.
12/5/22, 5:50 PM - +234 817 950 7218: That is the core issue. It's idealistic.

Idealistically health care should be free

According to the law, emergency services are free

But if you have hospital, go and give free emergency services. By your 5th EMCS with no return it's your accountant that will tell you to pack your bags
12/5/22, 5:52 PM - +234 817 950 7218: The last time I watched him he was disappointing

The person who impressed me yesterday was Kwankwanso

Atiku said nothing tangible

Very vague an unspecific, any small thing he will say privatisation and restructuring

He is not a dullard but if you scrutinize his ideas there was no substance at all at all

Atiku to me was clearly the weakest link
12/5/22, 5:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂😂
His economic techniques are antiquated

Every two sentences privatization. The man doesn't understand poverty
12/5/22, 6:02 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Health care is never free, this is where your missing it!. That is appears free doesn't mean  others are not contributing to it.

That you had a RTA and you were admitted and did not pay a dime did not mean NHIS never paid for it or Nigerians never contributed to it.

I don't think you have a good depth of how health insurance works or should work.

That you have a private hospital and they say patients should not pay for emergency services does not mean you would not be paid or operate at a loss. The NHIS will pay.
12/5/22, 6:03 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Again I support Peter Obi. I need to declare that conflict of interest. However, a lot of holes can be punctured in this idealistic goal. 133 million is well over 60% of the population. As luadable as it is, it is  highly unrealistic considering Nigerias present financial state
12/5/22, 6:03 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Chatham House today

*Question*: How will you stop oil theft?

*Tinubu*: Excuse me, that does not mean a departure from the present administration. 

The classification, a theft & a receiver exist.. so you have to classify the receiver as taking blood money
12/5/22, 6:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: A better approach may have been to prioritize certain key populations like Womennand children esp those who do not earn a salary. And then cover essentials like Maternal and under 5 populations
12/5/22, 6:04 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Anybody still supporting this man after this kind of answer needs their head examined
12/5/22, 6:04 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Get your point victor. 

If we are planning to spend 6 trillion on subsidy, and you stop that and pay that as your contribution to NHIS to cover more Nigerians, is that not a master stroke
12/5/22, 6:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The Geriartic population amongst other
12/5/22, 6:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Like he always uses data. He should have stratified the population and focus on the most vulnerable. The average Nigerian is already used to out of pocket payments
12/5/22, 6:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Stopping subsidy also is actually unrealistic. It would be a systematic and stepwise approach
12/5/22, 6:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: So that 6 trillion will not be abruptly available
12/5/22, 6:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Another approach he could have used was to focus more funding on Primary Prevention of diseases
12/5/22, 6:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you achieve mass screenings and advance preventive lifestyles you minimize the number of people who become diseased or enter the stage of complications
12/5/22, 6:07 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes it looks like the money is not there, but it actually is!. It's just that we are spending it on the wrong deliverables.
If we channel what we maintain state house clinic, what we spend on subsidy, what we spend to maintain the presidential fleet. If we get 1% percent tax from what Nigerians spend on wine or Alcohol, the monies you are all afraid of will be the thing of the past 

This is the thinking. PO will not come out to say this.and this is what he will do
12/5/22, 6:07 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You spend less on Managing complications
12/5/22, 6:09 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I said idealistically Dr. Lol

This interaction is exhausting
12/5/22, 6:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Well if he puts it like you did, the undecided would incline towards him
12/5/22, 6:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The telephone idea is brilliant. Even charge 5% for every data recharge.
12/5/22, 6:10 PM - +234 810 006 7926: PO will stop it from day 1. It's is an organized crime.  Let me ask, oil is subsidized right? How many of us can access it? How many Nigerian Airline owners can access avaiation fuel?( How much is flight ticket?) How many can afford diesel to power their buisnesses?
12/5/22, 6:11 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Of course
12/5/22, 6:12 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes this is always cheaper in the long run.
12/5/22, 6:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: <Media omitted>
12/5/22, 6:15 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Thank you Victor.

You are butressing my point which is what Abiola is failing to see

Peter Obi is not well read in healthcare and doesn't know it well enough

I don't know why Abiola is trying to paint a picture like Obi has wonderful practical ideas that will solve our healthcare issues

When clearly there are many holes

I don't blame him, you can't know everything

Hopefully he can bring in those who know if he wins
12/5/22, 6:15 PM - +234 810 006 7926: See if you take just 1% from VAT of things like maintenance costs for private jets, yatchs, wine, hotel stays etc, you will generate billions in the immediate.

There are other sustainable and viable options in the offing, but OBI won't come out to tell you how he will carry out his job, otherwise you can guess what will happen
12/5/22, 6:15 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There was a question on makin the LGs functional. Not so sure who answered that question properly
12/5/22, 6:16 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Particularly on how to ensure they get their funding and put to good use
12/5/22, 6:16 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think all three were for divulging powers and allowing the LGs run with their own funds
12/5/22, 6:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: For you to properly tax people, you have to have a proper data base of who has what and actual value of “what”
12/5/22, 6:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Our data base in Nigeria is in shambles
12/5/22, 6:17 PM - +234 817 950 7218: And that's the other thing

All of them where talking about PHCs and primary healthcare

The problem there is still the same, they keep building and building nonsense structure

Lack of man power and consumables are the issues in primary health care. But people keep talking about building PHCs

We keep having old empty dilapidated buildings and 10years later people are trying to build more

Instead of creating a sustainable system that can help these systems function
12/5/22, 6:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I recently came across data that suggested only 65% on average of people in the south are banked ie have a bank acct
12/5/22, 6:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And in the north central it’s 42% and 28-35% from North west to North Easy
12/5/22, 6:18 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup

It's to do the cost analysis. Estimate how much the insurance scheme will need and know what to bill the people to raise the desired amount
12/5/22, 6:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is mostly men. It’s far less for the female population particularly in the north
12/5/22, 6:19 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you are going to have a robust tax net, this has to be addressed
12/5/22, 6:19 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Agree, but VAT is usually at paypoint . You necessarily don't need data to do this but can build your data from the traffic of remittances.

So I go to a supermarket and I get a VAT of 5% on the non essential goods I bought. The teller withdraws this at paypoint and the banks do the needful
12/5/22, 6:20 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: They understand PHC as infrastructure and not a concept
12/5/22, 6:20 PM - +234 810 006 7926: More Nigerians drink wine than most countries in the world. If I'm not mistaken we spend more than any country on importing wine
12/5/22, 6:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You begin to wonder if they consulted widely on these issues
12/5/22, 6:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Or hve even Learnt from their past mistakes
12/5/22, 6:21 PM - +234 817 950 7218: If he stops it from day 1 he is finished

I support him and I have listened to him

This is not his intention

When he says subsidy is a scam, it's because a lot of the money being channelled for subsidy doesn't go into subsidy

Some of the fuel being subsidized is smuggled to our neighbors

POs plan for subsidy is to block the holes

Make sure the only fuel being subsidized is the one that Nigerians are actually using

And then systematically ease out the subsidy and maintain reasonable government expenditure on subsidy
12/5/22, 6:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 😁 my man Abiola, Less than 30% of financial transactions in Nigeria happen in high end stores where vat is deducted at pay points
12/5/22, 6:23 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: As you move from the south to the north that percentage or gap widens further
12/5/22, 6:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He has said he will remove it from day 1, Tinubu in his manifesto is the one proposing gradual phase out.

Atiku tried gradual phase out and Yaradua never completed it or Jonathan who was frustrated by Tinubu who claims to gradually phase it
12/5/22, 6:24 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: How many people selling Ogbono or Egusi ad tax when they charge
12/5/22, 6:24 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Lol

How many Nigerians have yachts? 

This idea you are pushing is similar to Buharis. That's why they keep increasing tax and making things hard for Nigerians

Because if they tax wine, it is still me and you that will pay for it

People keep trying to use tax to generate revenue. 

So 1% for health, then1% for education, then for agriculture, then for road, the for housing

Before you finish bag of rice is N100,000 because of tax
12/5/22, 6:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Not really, online transactions make more than 50% of the daily transactions. That is one pool you can get your VAT from
12/5/22, 6:26 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I think Atiku understood that one best.

Infact that was another thing

Atiku and Kwankwanso had clear but contrasting ideas

Kwankwanso wants local government to get allocation direct and in full

Atiku said they were doing that before but it wasn't working and that they need to find a balance.

Obi didn't seem to grasp that particular issue clearly
12/5/22, 6:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This is how it works. Ogbono is food and can't be taxed.

Now the online payments you make on Alibaba, Amazon, When you buy shoes, wears, wine( non essential items) is what will be taxed
12/5/22, 6:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Guys with cryptos, the tech startups worth over 1 billion dollars headquartered in Nigeria and other start ups are the pool
12/5/22, 6:29 PM - +234 817 950 7218: They haven't really learned unfortunately

I always say that left to me minister of health should mandatorily be a public health physician

These health issues need experts

Politicians are often clueless

They keep saying more money more money
12/5/22, 6:29 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Toh
12/5/22, 6:30 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Atiku didn't do anything abeg..

He hasn't been president before

Man is trying to ride on Obasanjo's wave
12/5/22, 6:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: So the issue is not where will he get the money from, but if he has the boldness to carry out his lofty ideas.
The whole idea is let the tax of the rich equilibrate or compensate from the little or nothing coming from the poor
12/5/22, 6:30 PM - +234 817 950 7218: He is talking about buying akara and yam

Building bread from malam.

You can VAT those things my brother
12/5/22, 6:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: You are missing Anyebe's point

How many Nigerians do you think use Alibaba? Even in this group I'm sure less than 5% have ever ordered on Ali baba
12/5/22, 6:32 PM - +234 817 950 7218: You want to run down start ups with tax abi?
12/5/22, 6:33 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Guy I don't think you understand the numbers.

Just Google search how much Nigerians spend on online transactions and just calculate 5 percent of that, that make you understand what I'm saying
12/5/22, 6:34 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Please on what page of his manifesto did he say he is removing subsidy from day 1?

I can't find it
12/5/22, 6:34 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
12/5/22, 6:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Totally not getting it.

The point is how much profit are those Unicorns who make their monies in dollars remit taxes?

Do you know how many Nigerians do sport betting? Do you know how much can be made from just 0.5 percent of these daily
12/5/22, 6:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Start ups can still survive with paying just 0.5 percent of the millions to billion of dollars they make in protis
12/5/22, 6:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: * profit
12/5/22, 6:37 PM - +234 817 950 7218: So if I send N100 to victor, government will collect N5


Then Victor sends it to Tony, they collect another N5, then Tony send to Rowland, they collect N5 and that's how it continues

Check am now?

I want to buy car of 2million, I transfer to the seller, government collect N100,000

Omo

I done Japa once they announce such

Infact people will just start keeping money in their back yard
12/5/22, 6:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Like you said, the drag is becoming exhausting
12/5/22, 6:40 PM - +234 810 006 7926: When PO becomes president allow him think on how to pool funds. He has my mandate, trust and the capacity to get those funds you have no idea, where they will be coming from
12/5/22, 6:40 PM - +234 817 950 7218: They are paying their tax already

A handsome tax

The idea of growth is to make it profitable

Not to tax people who are trying to run a business

In fact people are talking about zero tax to encourage investors and create jobs

Some countries are complaining about it and saying it's not fair

Because once you reduce tax people want to do business in their country and it's profitable

And with investors we have jobs


Your overall argument is one of looking at people with Money and trying to collect some of it from them

That's a dangerous way to try and generate revenue and many investors will leave your country immediately
12/5/22, 6:41 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I, you and Anyebe are all voting for Obi

He has all our mandates

If he said the things you are saying here today many people won't vote him
12/5/22, 6:50 PM - +234 810 006 7926: There was a total of 4.6 trillion spent by Nigerians in 7 months by using their ATMs to pay for goods and services. Now just one percent of this as tax is astronomical Victor. 
You don't need data  for this to scale through.

Now let's see sports betting, if 0.5percent of what people's spend on this is astronomical.

These are the areas Obi and his team will shore up resources to cater for the health needs of  133m
12/5/22, 6:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: How does sending money equate to paying for a good or service Chinedu?
12/5/22, 6:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Even when you send money, you cannot tax the value of what you send but rather you can tax the profit flutterwave makes from making your transaction happen
12/5/22, 6:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I think your not getting the numbers Noble one.
But this is how it works. If Lagos is way ahead of other states for IGR, it is because they are doing some of these things
12/5/22, 6:57 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Sending money is an online transaction

It is you who said we should Google how much is spent on online transaction


That aside

Even for buying and selling.

Taxing 5% on online sales will simply mean that things bought online will be 5% higher than things bought in the market

This will automatically KILL the online market

Meaning a phone of N100,000 at Rwang Pam will be N105,000 online

I will go to Rwang Pam and the online market will DIE
12/5/22, 6:58 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Surprise you have not attended the virtual meeting or seen videos where he said he will remove it from day 1
12/5/22, 6:58 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Please send a video or link

I just want to hear it from his mouth

I've never heard it before
12/5/22, 6:58 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Just send one please.

Thanks
12/5/22, 6:59 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Guy, it must not be 5%.I have talked on 1% and even 0.5%. I wander why you are fixated on an example that was made for 5%
12/5/22, 6:59 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Basically Lagos is the power house and economic center of Nigeria

No matter how Lalong wants to tax  on plateau

He can't get Lagos like IGR
12/5/22, 7:00 PM - +234 810 006 7926: No I won't do that. I did that with your claims of Nigerians not been the smartest. I won't do that this time.

Obviously you have not ffd Obi enough to know his indepth plans
12/5/22, 7:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Source ? Do you know what the internet coverage in Nigeria is? Or let me use the word internet penetration
12/5/22, 7:07 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Lol

Well, I disagree with you

There is no such video

Because I have watched them ask him about his plans for subsidy removal

He always says subsidy is a scam and talks about the issues with it

He has NEVER said he will remove subsidy from day 2
12/5/22, 7:07 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Day 1
12/5/22, 7:08 PM - +234 810 006 7926: <Media omitted>
12/5/22, 7:09 PM - +234 810 006 7926: As above
12/5/22, 7:13 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 3G broadband coverage is estimated to hit 70% in 2025
12/5/22, 7:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: And you have more with 2G coverage
12/5/22, 7:15 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
12/5/22, 7:16 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: @2348100067926 I totally get your point. Remember the goal was fund raising to address these enormous goals of PO. I think we might need to break these issues into stages. Especially defining clearly how taxation works
12/5/22, 7:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I agree Nigerians spend a lot on the internet. When person A goes to sports betting and plays his bet, am not sure the VAT he pays goes to FIRS. Am sure tho the Business owner eg Naijabet will have tax demanded from him
12/5/22, 7:18 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
12/5/22, 7:18 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes and this is where Point of pay with VAT may be a viable option
12/5/22, 7:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: When people transact on Alibaba or Konga etc and buy goods or services, I know they pay for the goods and a surcharge if they pay VAT I am still not sure it goes to FIRS. Maybe it goes to the company who is in turn charged by FIRS
12/5/22, 7:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Am trying to just clear the air on how taxation works you know
12/5/22, 7:19 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: i do not think Obis economic team will brainstorm any magical ideas outside of what we are already doing
12/5/22, 7:19 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly. You can be doing multiple taxations because you are seeing money

You want to keep collecting because you think those are vices. Wine, betting etc

Meanwhile the church isn't paying tax

Shouldn't the church pay tax?
12/5/22, 7:19 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Most ATMs for POS transaction is either powered by master card or verve
12/5/22, 7:19 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Remember that the second stage is even when all these taxes are obtained, do they really get remitted to Govt in totality. Which is where I expect his Govt to sanitize the taxation system
12/5/22, 7:20 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: FIRS is one of the highly paid federal agencies yet the place reeks of corruption to the high Heavens
12/5/22, 7:20 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let’s not even go to Remita
12/5/22, 7:20 PM - +234 817 950 7218: My point is that 91% of Nigerians do not do digital transactions


You were creating a false impression by posting this business day article headline

You know they use headlines for sensationalism

If you had read the first sentence you'll see that's simply not the case
12/5/22, 7:21 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your concerns of remittances to the FIRS is genuine. You heard someone say some staff earn more than the president. This is where the political will and accountabilty of Obi will come into play
12/5/22, 7:21 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Victor is telling you matter of factly, you can't be talking about things as though we are in Sweden

Most Nigerians don't buy things online
12/5/22, 7:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Trust me they do, as I have been in that niche before. With Amazon opening in Nigeria now, expect more
12/5/22, 7:23 PM - +234 817 950 7218: These are Obi's selling points. Blocking leakages and fixing systems. 

Not chasing away the middle class

If they do these things Abiola is saying, me sef i go Japa

I buy online tax, I buy wine tax, I bet tax, meanwhile I'm paying income tax

I go just Japa fast
12/5/22, 7:23 PM - +234 817 950 7218: They don't

Data suggest otherwise

Did you see what I posted?
12/5/22, 7:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: True and this is where Obi and Datti will be the game changer
12/5/22, 7:24 PM - +234 817 950 7218: This i agree with
12/5/22, 7:24 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Which niche? My gatemen and the woman I buy akara from have never bought anything online
12/5/22, 7:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 3G broadband coverage is not a correct proxy for internet penetration I hope you know
12/5/22, 7:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Victor. If you have a 3G network it can power any phone transfer or POS terminal.
12/5/22, 7:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: In fact with Google pay now I can use my phone rather than my ATM card or scan a barcode. These things have begun in Nigeria
12/5/22, 7:28 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Refer to my initial statement on the number of Nigerians who even have a bank account
12/5/22, 7:29 PM - +234 817 950 7218: You are missing Victors point

How many Nigerians are using all these things
12/5/22, 7:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You are still referring to Nigerians with a bank account
12/5/22, 7:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This was why I began with that statistic
12/5/22, 7:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your question should be how many Nigerians make online transactions?

And expect you don't appreciate evidence, I'm afraid you won't relate
12/5/22, 7:32 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Which evidence? The fake business day opinion poll you posted that I have refuted?
12/5/22, 7:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Ok to summarize
12/5/22, 7:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think we all agree that PO has some ideas or better still has been able to adopt clear and coincise Problem definition
12/5/22, 7:34 PM - +234 810 006 7926: By what counter source. Or you have become an authority now and can question call Buisness day fake
12/5/22, 7:34 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 2. PO has some ideas, a few previously tried, could be improved upon with more political will, others a bit innovative but short of outright Excellent. Most requiring further analysis and refining
12/5/22, 7:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 3. On the issue of widening the tax Net, his political will would likely ensure plugging of leakages.
12/5/22, 7:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Hilarious. 🤣🤣🤣 Chinedu et al
12/5/22, 7:35 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Dear Abiola,
Kindly find above my evidence refuting your claim
12/5/22, 7:36 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Also find incase you missed it

Evidence from your article, showing clearing that the statistic you presented as evidence is literally hearsay from an opinion poll
12/5/22, 7:36 PM - +234 817 950 7218: This is statistica
12/5/22, 7:37 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Oil dey your head
12/5/22, 7:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 4. He can leverage on other demographics (financial) to widen the tax net. The phone recharge is a great idea. However the approach was used during OBj and should be analysed for successes. Gaps and room for improvement
12/5/22, 7:38 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: On this note, can we turn our focus to Brazils routing of South Korea?
12/5/22, 7:38 PM - +234 817 950 7218: 4-0

This one is like watching rape

It's cruel
12/5/22, 7:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol. Good ointment  for the belly.
12/5/22, 7:48 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The samba boys ain't in for a joke
12/5/22, 8:10 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Absolutely Victor. Any Gaps can be filled and improved upon.
12/5/22, 8:17 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Are we talking of how many people buy online or the Value of those 76 million which is put at 4 trillion in 7 months. Now calculate 1 percent of this.

If out of  over 200 m Nigerians, 133 is poor and over 76 million make financial transactions worth 4 trillion, is that not a pool to get monies to put in the NHIS?

Nota Bene, online transactions is not limited to use of cards. Did you factor transfers from phones.

Your statistics of 37 percentage using ATMs is even significant.

You have to understand these potentials before trying to find holes in things, I don't think you have full grasp of
12/5/22, 8:28 PM - +234 817 950 7218: 🤣🤣🤣

I'm showing you that you are presenting false statistics, you're telling me I don't have the full grasp of what you are saying

Check economic policies

The basis of a your ideas are lie government of jealousy

Anywhere you see money, you want to dip hand and collect your share

It doesn't work that way

That is Buhari's way. Please don't stain Peter Obi with this type of economics

Peter Obi's principles are to convert Nigerian from consumption to production

And production requires investment

And not chasing away investors with excessive taxation

That is counter productive
12/5/22, 8:28 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's theirs for the taking
12/5/22, 8:28 PM - +234 817 950 7218: No dey put eye inside another person money

That's not how to raise money
12/5/22, 8:28 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Create value and you will generate revenue for everything
12/5/22, 9:12 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Vide supra
12/5/22, 9:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Been busy. Perfect headstart. Spot on when you say political will

12/9/22, 9:10 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *The world cup expectations* 

Fans all over the world have pressured the prophet to give them a verdict. 

As one closer to the gods than the common man they must remember: A prophet can’t force the gods to speak at any particular time. 

Brazil should beat Croatia this evening all things being equal. 
Croatia winning because of the excess hype around Neymar will be nice. 

Brazil playing against Argentina in future should be avoided. We don't want obstacles even though it can be surmounted. 

Argentina should beat Netherlands this evening. But the gods have warned that — prophecy of a true prophet may not come to pass on the other hand, if the people heed the warnings and remove what the gods dislike. 

Morocco should beat Portugal tomorrow. The tears of Ronaldo going home will be satisfying to the soul. 
But some people have claimed Moroccans are Africans and are forming solidarity that the blackman is not cursed. Perhaps Morocco losing may win the argument. 

A win - win for the gods and the prophet. True prophecy has the glory of the gods as its focus.


France should beat England tomorrow. The English keep bragging 'it's coming home', an annoying phrase – for that they should lose. 
But France equally retaining the world cup title back to back may not be good and could bring about pride. The gods dislike a haughty mind.


The prophet will consult the gods for further clarifications if need be. 

Prophecies are different from soothsaying and divination. They carry credibility and should delivered in line with the gods command.
12/9/22, 9:33 AM - +234 703 013 1067: We are following the prophesies closely.

12/10/22, 5:02 PM - +234 817 034 1232: If they had gone to a penalty shootout Morroco will still win

Their keeper is something else

Probably the best in this tournament 

No keeper comes close
12/10/22, 5:02 PM - +234 806 329 9675: *Congratulations MOROCCO!!!*👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
12/10/22, 5:02 PM - +234 810 006 7926: O boi. ET with 10 men is not safe
12/10/22, 5:03 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Congratulations to Morocco

12/10/22, 9:03 PM - Paul Ashir: Croatia v Argentina
France v Morocco.

What are the odds of Croatia v Morocco?
12/10/22, 9:11 PM - +234 806 329 9675: Hmmmm.....is POSSIBLE✅
12/10/22, 9:11 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Very high odds

They will play in third place match
12/11/22, 6:55 AM - +234 703 013 1067: Most likely Argentina vs France in the final but the prophet should speak first.
12/11/22, 7:01 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Let's consult the oracle 

Will be back with details
12/11/22, 8:49 AM - +234 810 006 7926: France may be favourites but they have proven that they can be beaten. Morocco stands a chance with France with the way they have played so far. If they keep their cool and realize that they are not there yet, they can beat France. Fingers crossed but will like to see a Morocco vs Argentina Final. Would love to see how two technically gifted teams draw blood.

12/11/22, 10:52 AM - Ceejaj: Being African is more geographical than biological. Africa is a continent and anyone born in Africa is considered African. Africa has other races aside the black race. There is the Arab race predominantly in North Africa, Indian settlers in East Africa and white/Caucasian race seen in southern Africa. 

Africa and its football stands to benefit much more if Morocco wins the world cup. 

2018 French winning world cup team is made up of 90% black player with ancestry  traceable to Africa continent but zero benefit to African football.
12/11/22, 10:54 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Nice submission👌🏼
12/11/22, 11:09 AM - +234 703 613 6886: I read this in your voice
12/11/22, 11:13 AM - Ceejaj: Sir Joweeeee

My brother whose grand father was taken away in a ship to America to work in a farm doesn't mean he's no longer my brother

I still recognize him as my brother
12/11/22, 11:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Shall we then pray for France to win 😀
12/11/22, 11:41 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Well I would like to see Argentina lift the cup or Croatia as second choice

But they are going to play against each other.

Note: This is the wish of the prophet. The gods have the final say which will be relayed accordingly
12/11/22, 11:47 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Croatia is the only team I'm indifferent about. If Argentina wins I'll be happy for Messi, if Morocco wins I'll be happy for Africa and Arabs, if France wins I'll be happy for Mbappe
12/11/22, 12:42 PM - +234 803 458 5862: I don't like Argentina...
12/11/22, 12:58 PM - +234 815 460 4407: But what of Messi? It's very difficult not to like that chap, an absolute sensation. 

Some percentage of your mind must be wishing him well. Involuntarily 😃
12/11/22, 1:07 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly

I know of their racist history and everything but it'll be nice to have Messi finally get the missing piece

It'll have been nice for Ronaldo as well and I'd have been happy for him

It's only England I really don't want to see win a world cup

But na wetin dey in heart in talk the first time
12/11/22, 1:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Playing safe with two sides of your mouth. There is nothing wrong if your predictions are wrong or the gods you speak for. After all your all human
12/11/22, 1:30 PM - +234 803 281 3842: 🤦🏾‍♂️
12/11/22, 1:31 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Can we see the rephrased version?
12/11/22, 1:40 PM - +234 817 034 1232: You know fragile humans 

Dem they always look for apology to feel good🤣
12/11/22, 1:41 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Lol

Who can battle with the gods
12/11/22, 1:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Morocco has never made any African more proud watching soccer.I hope Africa gets the 10 slots as promised when the world cup is expanded to 40 teams.
12/11/22, 1:56 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I see, we have been excluded in the equation.....I wish them all the best as a good team but no longer as an African team.
It's like an Igbo person excelling in Olympics and all he can say is that his wins are for the people of Biafra and the South East, while we are all celebrating him as a Nigerian
12/11/22, 2:12 PM - Paul Ashir: Omale, your analogy no follow.
12/11/22, 2:20 PM - +234 817 950 7218: This is only one man

In fairness to Morocco

But the others probably feel the same way in their minds

North African feel more affiliated with the middle east than with blacks
12/11/22, 2:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Simply put
12/11/22, 2:26 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Croatia V Morocco - finals

Who are you to predict this when the gods and his prophet have not given a verdict😊
12/11/22, 2:29 PM - +234 806 921 7904: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/11/22, 2:30 PM - +234 806 921 7904: What's the verdict of the gods please
12/11/22, 2:31 PM - +234 817 034 1232: The Morrocans have a right to feel that way

No serious/Successful race want to be associated with Africa or Africans 


Rather unfortunate they are sharing same geographical space with us.

Their ideology/mentality is different from us
12/11/22, 2:32 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Let's consult them 

Will inform accordingly
12/11/22, 2:36 PM - Paul Ashir: All the gods predict has a caveat each time.
12/11/22, 2:37 PM - +234 817 034 1232: Not so 

There is Logos and there is Rhema for clarification 😀
12/11/22, 2:38 PM - Paul Ashir: Logos and Rhema are usually in unison.

12/11/22, 3:55 PM - +234 806 092 4290: You are probably right. Nevertheless, no matter how they feel affiliated, they know very well that they represent Africa as a continent, but the guy's public expression shows otherwise

12/11/22, 6:15 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Chi any of the 4 teams left in this world cup can win it as no team is invincible. At this stage of the competition, Croatia vs Morocco is a possibility that can happen and not wished Away.

Can Croatia beat ARG?

Can Morocco beat France? 

A likely possibility that may be a boring final, but possible.

With the Semi's, the odds in your favour as a favourite, diminishes
12/11/22, 6:15 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The Amazighs and the Nubians were long conquered by Arabs
12/11/22, 6:15 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And no one can take the arabness away from them
12/11/22, 6:16 PM - +234 803 097 7516: They do not know or have any other language as at today
12/11/22, 6:16 PM - +234 803 097 7516: No other mother tongue these generation of people have grown up to know
12/11/22, 6:17 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The ancient North African people were blacks but this has long become history. The ancient pharoahs were black too.
12/11/22, 6:17 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Morroco left AU for their own reason
12/11/22, 6:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But now they are here
12/11/22, 6:18 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But still part of Arab League
12/11/22, 6:19 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Morrocan are Arabs by conquest but unfortunately they don't have the privilege to spilt the soil to 'unafrican" themselves....this will always remind them that they belong here though not of here
12/11/22, 6:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The Comorian and Malagasy are purely Asians as well. Their descendants are from Indian and Malaysia
12/11/22, 6:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But unlike the North Africans these southern African guy have never for once thought of aligning with Asia
12/11/22, 6:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This is where politics comes in..The Arab world is a small population in Asia
12/11/22, 6:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Finding a significantly large populations of Sudan, Morocco Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt to gum body make them a bit relevant
12/11/22, 6:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And can be significant
12/11/22, 6:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Saudi and UAE are responsible for influencing the divide just to buy population and stay relevant
12/11/22, 6:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Same thing G20 is planning add AU to G20 to save us from BRICS
12/11/22, 6:22 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The Russian planned coalition
12/11/22, 7:13 PM - +234 706 656 2719: Learning here
12/11/22, 7:39 PM - +234 806 092 4290: 👏🏼Educative
12/11/22, 7:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: "save us" from BRICS? How? Expantiate. I thought BRICS was supposed to prevent the monopoly of economy by the West
12/11/22, 7:42 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol to the Westttt they are saving us 🤣
12/11/22, 7:43 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Abi...
12/11/22, 8:08 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Thought BRICS was an acronym for  the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia,India,China, South Africa? More like G7 counteies

12/12/22, 4:31 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Russian China those area the threat to the other coalition who think they run everything
12/12/22, 5:34 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Interesting. This looks like something written from someone who is working and maybe trained in Kano. 

In political season my ear is always out for politics that's why I found her "they didn't give me shishi" interesting ( showing a heightened, perhaps normalized awareness of Peter Obi in Kano.

And then a slight jab at Buhari when talking about going to London for ear infection

@2348036350279 how is Kano? What is the political environment like there?
12/12/22, 6:25 AM - +234 803 635 0279: The politics here seems the same as seen in other parts of the country.
Is Peter Obi the majorities  choice here? I don't think so.
Do they prefer Tinubu to Atiku? They both seems to have their crowd,but the elections will tell. 
One thing I know is people are tired of the current state of the nation and are looking forward for the elections.
12/12/22, 7:03 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's interesting and good to know

Dunno who to support 😃
12/18/22, 4:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol dey where you dey
12/18/22, 4:50 PM - +234 806 675 1526: One question: why did the coach have to sub angel Dimaria?
12/18/22, 4:50 PM - +234 806 921 7904: 😃😃😃
12/18/22, 4:51 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: He thought it was done and over with
12/18/22, 4:51 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Probably wanted to defend
12/18/22, 4:51 PM - +234 806 675 1526: If you don’t have a strong Defence and have the luck of good attackers that can score, why would you sub them?
12/18/22, 4:51 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Yeah.. I think so too
12/18/22, 4:51 PM - +234 806 675 1526: And you playing against a team that scores
12/18/22, 4:52 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: He didn’t think they would come back with the lackluster performance over the earlier 75mins
12/18/22, 4:52 PM - +234 806 675 1526: You have to match them goal for goal! Now since the removal of dimaria, Argentina lost that biting edge
12/18/22, 4:52 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And that’s why Deschamp introduced Coeman
12/18/22, 4:52 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly

That's all I want
12/18/22, 4:53 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We now have Argentina chasing the ball too. They became too relaxed
12/18/22, 4:53 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Unfortunately the game will tarry into the extras and France will have the day. 

Very poor call.
12/18/22, 4:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think Argentina still have fire power on the bench
12/18/22, 4:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The Juventus Star
12/18/22, 4:54 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Who?
12/18/22, 4:55 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Hez been mostly second option to Alvarez
12/18/22, 4:55 PM - +234 806 675 1526: My brother, this is the best they can offer right now. 

That coach should be sacked afterwards. 

This isn’t the first time he is making this blunder
12/18/22, 5:01 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Omo
12/18/22, 5:01 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Brahhhh
12/18/22, 5:02 PM - +234 803 310 4903: King Rome. Let it be known
12/18/22, 5:02 PM - +234 806 675 1526: That coach should be flogged. No be with stick o, with better cutlass
12/18/22, 5:02 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Fam fam!!
12/18/22, 5:02 PM - +234 817 950 7218: All I could have asked for 


An entertaining final
12/18/22, 5:03 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Agreed 🤔
12/18/22, 5:03 PM - +234 803 310 4903: On God
12/18/22, 5:03 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I'm good with whoever wins

Argentina wins

I'm happy for Messi. Goat sealed

France wins

I'm happy for the blacks and happy the racist Argentines are denied the world cup
12/18/22, 5:03 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Double entendres
12/18/22, 5:04 PM - +234 818 989 5529: 👍🏽
12/18/22, 5:05 PM - +234 818 989 5529: Yeah. I  even want win to score the winning goal.
12/18/22, 5:06 PM - +234 818 989 5529: *...him to...
12/18/22, 5:06 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Ballon d'or winner is Sha on this pitch
12/18/22, 5:07 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Terrible decision
12/18/22, 5:15 PM - Paul Ashir: If France had scored with Di Maria on the pitch, the coach would have been blamed for not bringing another body in the defence. Leading 2-0 with less than half an hour to go was not that grievous a sub
12/18/22, 5:18 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Frances subs really impacted the game and we really can’t say now that Di Maria’s stay would have been the difference
12/18/22, 5:19 PM - +234 806 675 1526: I disagree with you. Who initiated all the goals for the team? Who has been the biting force and thorn in the flesh of the French guys? 

In fact I am scarer of Maria than I am of Messi. 

There many players in the midfield that could have been subbed. The highest the coach would have done is changed positions. Maria moves to the right while Messi goes deeper. 

If he wanted to sub Maria, this should have come say in the 80sth minute.
12/18/22, 5:21 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Right now, only varane and the keeper are not black...just saying
12/18/22, 5:25 PM - Paul Ashir: Varane is black.
12/18/22, 5:29 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Messi
12/18/22, 5:29 PM - Paul Ashir: The joy of football. Comments are usu in retrospect. Should Acuna had turned on the heat as he usu does, this comment won't have been the case.
12/18/22, 5:29 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Well, there you have it
12/18/22, 5:33 PM - Paul Ashir: So, the coach can now be sacked and flogged with cutlass abi...
12/18/22, 5:35 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Yes. He still made a blunder. He is praying hard that this doesn’t cost him. 

The should have been won before now.
12/18/22, 5:36 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Na waooo
12/18/22, 5:36 PM - +234 806 675 1526: So yes, he still needs to be flogged. Especially if they lose the penalties.
12/18/22, 5:36 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Penalty
12/18/22, 5:37 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Mbappeee
12/18/22, 5:37 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Hat trick!
12/18/22, 5:38 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Fucking entertaining final man
12/18/22, 5:38 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Walahi 😃
12/18/22, 5:38 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Hard trick in a grand finale
12/18/22, 5:38 PM - +234 803 310 4903: NEW GOAT VS OLD GOAT. 
THIS IS AN EPIC FINAL. 
YOU SHOULD ALL CONSIDER YOURSELVES LUCKY TO EXPERIENCE GREATNESS
12/18/22, 5:38 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I swear down
12/18/22, 5:39 PM - +234 806 537 0692: The tension of the whole world cup in one match!!!
12/18/22, 5:39 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Very well said!
12/18/22, 5:39 PM - +234 803 310 4903: There might never be another final like this again especially as Messi is the great footballer of our own generation and the one to come
12/18/22, 5:39 PM - +234 706 098 3639: This world cup final sha!
12/18/22, 5:41 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Dybala is the guy I was referring to @2348066751526

12/18/22, 5:43 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Wow wow
12/18/22, 5:43 PM - Paul Ashir: Now with Roma. Not Juventus.
12/18/22, 5:43 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Under sec and both teams missed goal scoring opportunities
12/18/22, 5:44 PM - +234 803 281 3842: What a game- thank you
12/18/22, 5:44 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Omo x 10000
12/18/22, 5:44 PM - +234 803 310 4903: Even the commentary in the titans group is hot

12/18/22, 5:46 PM - +234 806 675 1526: As in from one post to another under 5seconds!
12/18/22, 5:49 PM - +234 803 310 4903: The world is going to end after this final because I don’t know if we can see as humans any final like this again. 
1)The greatest player of all time coming full circle and wining the World Cup before retiring
2)A new young generational talent looking at breaking new grounds and records. Nobody has ever scored a Hatrick in a World Cup final. 
3)Next world footballer of the year will be between Mbappe and Messi but would strictly be based on the World Cup winner. Non will outdo the other if there country doesn’t win. 
4)Mbappe might break Messi’s record for country but never club football
12/18/22, 5:50 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Well summarized!
12/18/22, 5:51 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Shitttttttttt

12/28/22, 12:55 PM - +234 703 714 8734: *PRINCE ARTHUR EZE'S REJECTION OF PETER OBI: A SIGN OF GOOD OAMEN, AN INDICATION THAT THERE IS TROUBLE IN THE KINGDOM OF DARKNESS IN NIGERIA, THE  VERY REASON THE MASSES MUST STAND BY PETER OBI.*

Before I tell us why the open rejection of Peter Obi, the Labour Party Presidential Candidate in the 2023 elections by Prince Arthur Eze is a good OAMEN, a sign of good thing to come for the ordinary Nigerian and the very reason Nigerians must stand up to support Peter Obi, let me tell those who do not know Prince Arthur Eze who he is.

Arthur Eze is a Nigerian oil mogul, philanthropist, politician, and the CEO of Atlas Oranto Petroleum, the largest privately held Nigerian exploration and production group. The Igbos call him, ‘ozoigbondu’ of Igboland and he is said to be the 8th wealthiest man in Africa. Prince Arthur Eze is from Anambra State.

*WHY ARHTUR EZE IS AFRAID OF PETER OBI*

Before the emergence of Peter Obi as governor of Anambra State in 2006,  Anambra State was one of the most dangerous states in Nigeria, held down by armed robbers on one side and on the other side, a set of very greedy and dangerous political godfathers which included amongts others, Prince Arthur Eze,  Chief Chris Uba  and many others.

Anambra State became ungovernable from 1999 to 2003 under Gov. Chiwonke Mbadinuju, a PDP governor, as it was a constant tusle between the governor and these greedy godfathers on who to control the finances of the State. In order to make sure that Chiwonke Mbadinuju is not given a second term in office, the tusle let to the killing of the Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Anambra branch and his wife  to finally tarnish the image of the then governor and put a stop to his second term ambition.

Chief Chiwonke Mbadinuju was succeeded in office by Dr. Chris Ngige another PDP governor in 2003 who was again sponsored by these greedy political godfathers and cabals. Again, Dr. Ngige was not allowed to rule the State as his refusal to part with almost all the internally generated revenue of the State  was seen as an a front and arround 2005, Dr. Ngige, a sitting governor was forcefully kidnapped and asked to resign which he refused. 

By providence, in 2006, the Judiciary came to the rescue of the Anambra people by declaring Peter Obi the actual winner of the 2003 governorship election in the state which saw the removal of the cabal-sponsored Chris Ngige from office and brought normalcy back to the State and the cabals who had no hands in the emergence of Peter Obi had to return to whatever business they were doing and that marked the end of them feasting on Anambra treasury, an act Arthur Eze will never forgive Peter Obi.

Again, Prince Arthur Eze as one of the Igbo 'political leaders' has been one of those negotiating nationally for what comes to the Igbo people. He has since 1999 remained one of the cabals that is on the neck of Nigeria. Recent news has it that since 1999 to date, for  anyone to become governor of Anambra State, you must meet certain condition given by Arthur Eze, except in the case of Peter Obi, which has much to do with parting with certain percentage of the State's internally generated revenue and giving him powers to appoint certain numbers of commissioners. No wonder, Gov. Chukwuma Soludo(Nwa Mgbafo) and Prince Arthur Eze are currently best of friends and the first action in office by Soludo as governor was to increase taxes paid by taxis and motorcycle riders.

So as to remain relevant both in business and politics, Prince Arthur Eze has remained friend with all the presidents in Nigeria and in 2019, he told the Igbo people to vote for Muhammadu Buhari because Buhari will handover to Engr. Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State. These formed part of the reasons Engr. David Umahi defected from PDP to APC  and today, will Buhari still hand over to David Umahi? Arthur Eze is currently asking Igbos to support Atiku Abubakar because Atiku will handover to Gov. Chukwuma Soludo. Will the Igbos and Nigerians believe this deceit from him again? 

Prince Arthur Eze has never supported any cause that will not be to the benefit of his business. His fear about Peter Obi is the general fear currently inherent in every person, man or woman that has been feasting  on Nigeria's treasury who believes the emergence of Peter Obi as president of Nigeria in 2023 will put a stop to it.

For you ordinary Nigerian yearning for good governance, hear me , more people like Arthur Eze will come up in the days ahead to say they don't support Peter Obi. But these are clear signs that there is trouble in the kingdom of darkness in Nigeria, a good oamen and reason we must all work to deliver Peter Obi in 2023 to free Nigeria and Nigerians from their captivity and bondage. If Zambia, Kenya, Rwanda could do it, my people, we can do it too in 2023.

12/30/22, 7:14 AM - +234 803 692 8469: I remain humble.

Una taink you
12/30/22, 7:25 AM - +234 703 963 4888: Nice one Adams, so proud of you bro. Keep the light shining.
12/30/22, 7:26 AM - +234 703 963 4888: I can now say that GYB is now far better than Lalong and of course Ortom😂😂😂
12/30/22, 8:42 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I particularly like the PPP aspect

That to me is the future of tertiary care in our Nigerian system

Dem @2348065683004  had their doubts but let's see how this one goes

Kudos
12/30/22, 8:59 AM - +234 806 329 9675: 👏👏👏👏👏

12/30/22, 9:21 AM - +234 810 006 7926: How many vehicles?
12/30/22, 9:21 AM - +234 703 013 1067: When you perform above expectations you walk with your shoulders high as we can see in the likes of GYB. For goodness sake when these things were being done and executed where was governor Lalong of plateau state. Kudos to GYB. 👍👍👍
12/30/22, 9:27 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Things are so bad one has to redefine standards. Govs commission projects that they were elected to do and we praise them like gods. 

We strongly desire leadership that will up the ante
12/30/22, 9:47 AM - +234 803 692 8469: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 10:31 AM - +234 806 092 4290: That's the sad state of the country. It's supposed to be the standard, but when we have most of our leaders underperforming, yet we can't hold them accountable, it is worth appreciating those that have done remarkable things, even if those were exactly the reasons we elected them. Again, same way we lambast them when they fail, we need to praise them when they achieve something.
12/30/22, 10:48 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Your principal has tried. Can score him 30 percent!
12/30/22, 10:48 AM - +234 810 006 7926: It is well
12/30/22, 11:55 AM - +234 806 675 1526: He performed better than his first tenure. It appeared he learnt some lessons. 

However, there were plenty of room for improvements but rather, he hopped upon an unrealistic voyage of contesting for the presidency when his public ratings as at then was nothing to write home about. Those monies would have gone into more worthy projects. 

In terms of policies, I wouldn’t say he achieved any milestones. 

In any case, within the plethora of underperforming governors and leaders, he should be patted on the back. 

Adams well done, I love what you helped influenced in the health sector, especially the modern equipment and hospital in central. More heights.
12/30/22, 12:01 PM - +234 803 692 8469: @2348066751526 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁

But his policies on finances accountability has earned him awards from world bank over the past 3-4years consecutively.
12/30/22, 12:03 PM - +234 803 692 8469: His policies has birthed the Kogi state health insurance agency.

@2348066751526 meanwhile thank you for the comments.

Ganduje is governor. Kano is an APC state

Projections suggest Kwakwanso to take the most and then Tinubu and Atiku to scrap for the remaining votes. That's the beauty of the election. Kano is not likely to block vote anyone this time

1/6/23, 11:44 AM - +234 803 658 2567: Hi everyone,

Happy new year

A paediatrician is needed in a school in Abuja (8am- 3pm) daily. 

Kindly let me know if you've got any recommendations.

Renumeration is negotiable
1/6/23, 12:01 PM - +234 817 950 7218: A school wants to employ a paediatrician? Like full-time?

Nigeria can't afford that

Paediatricians in Abuja fit no reach 20
1/6/23, 12:02 PM - +234 806 329 9675: 😳
1/6/23, 12:04 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Omame for Jesus

Abi are you free to go and stay in a school?
1/6/23, 12:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Maybe you could have asked “which school” first
1/6/23, 12:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If the PTA has decided they want that service in place, a school might go all out. And it’s Abuja so it may not be totally impossible
1/6/23, 12:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Issue would be wether they can meet the pediatricians terms
1/6/23, 12:10 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Or how much?
1/6/23, 12:10 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Unless na London School or tropical health

Nigeria cannot afford to have a paediatrician in a school abeg
1/6/23, 12:10 PM - +234 817 950 7218: London School of tropical health*
1/6/23, 12:26 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Another case of the rich wanting more resources for themselves,  when it's not enough for the masses
1/6/23, 12:44 PM - +234 806 329 9675: May consider depending on the package🤐
1/6/23, 12:44 PM - +234 806 329 9675: Hmmmmm....
1/6/23, 12:45 PM - +234 817 950 7218: @2348036582567 oya enter inbox
1/6/23, 1:04 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Unfortunately the world has never been fair. Equality is an eldorado
1/6/23, 1:11 PM - +234 803 281 3842: This message was deleted
1/6/23, 1:12 PM - +234 803 281 3842: True..but, paediatricians are in such few numbers that it doesn't seem appropriate to just keep one in a school full-time.  It's better to have a  school nurse full-time and the paediatrician can come in from time to time (locum)
1/6/23, 1:18 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Or an MO to review and paediatrician comes in
1/6/23, 1:19 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Yes

 But we still need to strive to achieve it

We can't see injustice and clap and say that's life

We fight injustice and unfairness, even though we know it will never fully be achieved
1/6/23, 2:22 PM - +234 703 656 1230: School wants a paediatrician, una dey hia3dey analyse. Na una be the school????? Ehhhh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1/6/23, 2:27 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The school is not sincere
1/6/23, 2:28 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Is peadiatrician all that is needed
1/6/23, 2:28 PM - +234 803 097 7516: What happens to having engagement with certain hospital
1/6/23, 2:28 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Having MoU in place is what schools do
1/6/23, 2:28 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Not having one consultant
1/6/23, 2:30 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Personal opinion o

1/6/23, 2:34 PM - +234 817 950 7218: They are just all these flamboyant schools feeling big

So they can charge parents plenty money and brag about having a full-time paediatrician
1/6/23, 2:34 PM - +234 806 566 2895: One politician has five MOPOL, even Adams has 3 🏃🏿‍♂️😜

And you're complaining about one chenkere school wey dey hustle paediatrician?
1/6/23, 2:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: In reality what big school actually do is to have you enter your kid paediatrician on the application form
1/6/23, 2:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The assumption is that every big man child should be covered by insurance
1/6/23, 2:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: In the event you don't have one then the school makes a recommendation from a list to you
1/6/23, 2:36 PM - +234 817 950 7218: My first few weeks of nysc was in a secondary school. Half the children coming to see me just wanted to leave class. 80% had fake symptoms or just unspecific discomforts that didn't need any treatment
1/6/23, 2:37 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Is that what they want to do with paediatrician? To be managing teen drama?
1/6/23, 2:44 PM - +234 803 658 2567: You check am bah?
1/6/23, 2:45 PM - +234 803 658 2567: Na just recommendation I ask for oh. 

You get abi you no get? #packam📌
1/6/23, 2:57 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Even the Good book says the poor you will have with you always.  The science that we have studied also highlights the  survival of the fittest. I am in full support of the pursuit of happiness, but as a global agenda, it will often prove elusive because humans are involved and these humans are not infallible and wil always have bias
1/6/23, 3:05 PM - +234 803 458 5862: My brother, Nigerians like showmanship. I just imagine that some parents will go around saying "I take my child to a school that has a paediatrician"
I can bet that even bigger schools in the US don't have pediatricians! All you need is a family physician (that's even if it is necessary!)
A good nurse with an ambulance and referal hospital within the vicinity may just suffice.
1/6/23, 3:21 PM - +234 806 568 3004: The paediatrician should specify a salary  and he/she will be paid. Abi no be money the Paediatrician dey find😂😜
1/6/23, 3:38 PM - +234 806 329 9675: 😳🙆‍♂️
1/6/23, 3:42 PM - +234 806 329 9675: Why are you spoiling my business????!😡
1/6/23, 4:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: A tell you
1/6/23, 5:09 PM - +234 803 281 3842: We have to analyse it cos we are doctors na..if we dey analyse politics, we definitely should analyse stuff like this..
1/6/23, 5:12 PM - +234 803 281 3842: There is no rational need for a specialist in a school on full-time basis.  And definitely, not specialists in short supply. A school clinic,at best can be a primary health care centre..at best.

*$1 = ₦890*
*€1 = ₦810*

*ATTENTION*

*In case you don't know the root cause of our problems today, please take time out and read below:*

*As of 25/07/2022, the exchange rates were:*

*£1 = ₦800*
*$1 = ₦670*
*€1 = ₦662*

*42 years ago, precisely on 25/07/1980 the exchange rate was:*
*$1 = 0.80k*

*Are you surprised?* 

*Well, we were far more productive in 1980 than we are today.*

*In 1980 the key reasons for economic growth were as follows:*

*1. We were a net exporter of refined petroleum products. Today we import all our refined petroleum products.*

*2. We rode in locally assembled cars, buses and trucks. Peugeot cars in Kaduna and Volkswagen cars in Lagos.*

*3. Leyland produced  trucks/buses in Ibadan and ANAMCO in Enugu also produced buses and trucks.*

*4. Steyr in Bauchi produced our Agricultural tractors. And it was not just Assembly, we were producing many of the components:*

*5. Vono products in Lagos produced the vehicle seats.*
 
*6. Exide in Ibadan produced the batteries, not just for Nigeria but for the entire West Africa.*

*7. IsoGlass and TSG in Ibadan produced the windshields.*

*8. Ferrodo in Ibadan produced the brake pads and discs*

*9. Dunlop produced Tyres  in Lagos and Michelin Tyres were produced in Port Harcourt. And I mean tyres produced from rubber plantations located in Ogun, Bendel and Rivers State.*

*10.  We were listening to Radio and watching television sets assembled in Ibadan by Sanyo.*

*11. We were using refrigerators, freezers and Airconditioners produced by Thermocool and Debo.*

*12.  We were putting on clothes produced from the UNTL Textile Mills in Kaduna and Chellarams in Lagos. They were Not from imported cotton but from cotton grown in Nigeria.*

*13.  Our water was running through pipes produced by Kwalipipe in Kano and Duraplast in Lagos .*

*14.  Our toilets were fitted with WC produced in Kano and Abeokuta.*

*15  We were cooking with LPG gas stored inside gas cylinders produced at the NGC factory in Ibadan.*

*16. Our electricity was flowing through cables produced by the Nigerian Wire and Cable, Ibadan; NOCACO in Kaduna and Kablemetal in Lagos and Port Harcourt.*

*17.  We had Bata and Lennards Stores producing the shoes we were putting on. The shoes were not from imported leather but from locally tanned leather in Kaduna*.

*18.  We were mainly flying our Airways, (the Nigeria Airways), to most places in the world. The Nigeria Airways was about the biggest in Africa at the time*.

*19. Most of the foods we ate were grown or produced in Nigeria*.

*We were producing all of the above and many more in 1980*

*Today, we import almost everything. Isn't that alarming?*

*There you have it, the source of the terrible exchange rate we are experiencing today and everyone reading this has a critical role to play in reversing this very UGLY trend.*
 
*We have been talking about these problems and more for ages.*

*It is not enough for us to complain about the exchange rate or point out what others are not doing or are failing to do. The key questions are:*

*1. What are we producing now?*
*2. What role are our so- called Leaders/ Politicians of today playing?* 

*We are forever shying away from responsibility whereas it is a stack reality and if we don't deal with it, it won't go away. In fact it will get worse*.

*To our dear Politicians, if you don't have the capacity to RESET Nigeria to what it was at least back in 1980 then please stay in your house and don't waste our time.*

*ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !!!*

*Please share widely on all platforms for Nigerians especially youths to know the critical role to play with.. #Fixing_Nigeria*.

*WE NEED A PERSON WITH VERY GOOD THINKING FACULTY TO RULE/LEAD OUR NATION.*

Tinubu does not have a mind of his own, same script played out in Edo where oshiomole was the one whispering words into Tinubu's ears.

This is how they will package a sick man and run a govt by cabals under his watch.

If this is the man you want to represent you in the UN General assembly, then may your wish never come true. Obviously a BH sympathiser in Shettima, will technically be the man in charge!.

1/8/23, 3:35 PM - +234 806 568 3004: *Goodafternoon dear Colleagues* 

This is to inform everyone of us that the seasonal outbreak of *lassa fever* is here again.  We have observed an increase in number of cases diagnosed and admitted in our facility over the past one week. 

As against the 1 to 5 number of cases seen per week (over the preceeding weeks) we admitted over 20 cases in the past 4days. The sudden upsurge in the number of cases is a common phenomenon yearly as we approach the peak season in lassa endemic states of Nigeria. 

The distribution of patients have been widespread. In our cases, the patients are not limited to Edo, but cuts across refering neighboring states and communities. 

Please be informed; have a high index of suspicion and follow all IPC measures in care of your patients.

Thank you

1/9/23, 12:36 AM - +234 810 006 7926: I Hope this puts to rest Obi's stance on fuel subsidy.
1/9/23, 12:50 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Easier said than done

I guess he is growing firmer in his resolves over time
1/9/23, 12:54 AM - +234 810 006 7926: It's has been his position from day 1. 
6 trillion on subsidizing fuel that is unavailable to Nigerians is a scam that must be stopped immediately.
1/9/23, 1:31 AM - +234 806 092 4290: While fuel subsidy is a scam and an avenue to enrich the few, you cannot stop it completely without viable refineries in the country. When you stop it and the players of the market decide to frustrate you, and fuel is sold above N500 per litre, then you will understand that the same Obidients will roast you. Your policy may be good but if it affects the day to day activities of the masses negatively, even if temporary, that seat in Aso Rock will be too hot for you.
You can't assume you know everything happening there until you get in, study and analyse the game. You can't just be inaugurated as president and the next morning you declare removal of subsidy. That "Day 1" is unrealistic for me
1/9/23, 3:59 AM - +234 806 529 3872: Yea. That Day 1 seems more like a figure of speech.
1/9/23, 4:00 AM - +234 806 529 3872: The message is that he will remove subsidy ASAP once elected.
1/9/23, 5:37 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Even if elected as a military head of state, it would be difficult.

Obi sometimes speaks as though Nigeria is public liability company He registered with CAC.

Nigeria is complex and the politics in it is sophisticatedly dirty.

Cabals and their livelihood built around the subsidy scam over decades would rather burn down this country than allow him, they would sponsor chaos and media propaganda that would shake the fabric of the country.

And the foreign countries making their budget base on our fuel subsidy would covertly work with the cabals.

By the time fuel sells for 1500 naira per litre the masses would turn against Obi and he would be seen as the Graham Potter of Chelsea.

Obi's heart is good , but he needs to balance it with the political reality of Nigeria and Nigerians.
1/9/23, 5:42 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Removing it? Sure he has the firm will to do so.

But ASAP, hmmm, it wof be hard. Politician can add some lies to their talk.

Na who enter house know how the house dirty and which broom to use.

Consider Electricity, even OBJ couldn't.

Just believe the best from your candidates, don't have high hopes.

Advice from a Cardiology point of view.
1/9/23, 5:43 AM - Paul Ashir: ASAP can be 3 years.
1/9/23, 5:45 AM - +234 817 950 7218: There are 2 key steps before removing subsidy. The first one is making sure that all the money paid for subsidy is actually used to import fuel. A lot of the subsidy money currently is just on paper. Some of them just trade the dollar in the black market and make profit

The second is to ensure that the subsidized fuel stays within the shores of Nigeria and not smuggled in large amounts across the border to Benin and Chad and Niger as it's currently done

If you do those two then the cost of subsidy will probably be cut in half


After that a stepwise reduction in subsidy payment while working on being able to locally refine crude will do the rest

That way by the first day of potential second term in 2027 subsidy could be completely removed
1/9/23, 5:46 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Sure...

Not day 1, meaning he was not saying the full truth or perhaps he was speaking political bala Blue.

In 3 years, he would have built in to the system an alternative market or production systems , enough time to politically behind close doors speak to the stake holders in that sector to consider buying into his ideas and show them out it would also benefit them.

3 years if he works hard, it could be done.
1/9/23, 5:47 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Oil dey your head👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
1/9/23, 5:47 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I have heard him speak on subsidy multiple times and I can almost guarantee that he won't remove it immediately

He's not that naive
1/9/23, 5:47 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Perfect
1/9/23, 5:48 AM - +234 706 647 6470: He can not.

Even in His dreams, he would be scared of doing so.

That is if he really understands political economy
1/9/23, 5:50 AM - +234 806 092 4290: 3 years is no longer ASAP. The electorates won't understand that. And the opposition will keep quoting his campaign promises. So let him be diplomatic with some promises.
Nigeria is complicated to rule. The first good sign of his success is the heart and commitment to serve the country and not see Aso Rock as an opportunity to enrich himself and cronies
1/9/23, 5:52 AM - +234 706 647 6470: <Media omitted>
1/9/23, 5:53 AM - +234 706 647 6470: Immediately in politics may just be the end of his second tenure if elected and still in office.

The English in politics is different from the use of English we wrote in Jamb that year
1/9/23, 6:32 AM - Paul Ashir: Yeap. Maybe he should have used ASAP rather than day 1. ASAP is as soon as possible and is not tied to a date. Chino's thoughts look more like the realistic way of going about it.
1/9/23, 10:12 AM - +234 810 006 7926: This message was deleted
1/9/23, 10:17 AM - +234 810 006 7926: The current PIA( petroleum industry act/bill) as ammended and signed does not make room for subsidy, but rather the market forces of demand and supply to determine prices with govt been the regulator. 

So by Law, Obi is spot on by removing it from day one( you don't prolong a scam by playing politricks, you cut it from the root to prevent if from festering). Don't forget Dangote refinery would have come on stream and can uptake all our local demands and export to neighboring countries. 

The question is why export crude oil and pay dearly to have it refined and imported, only for the pockets of  few politicians to be  'subsidized ', when we can pay naira to have it refined locally.

Another question is Kerosene is subsidized, how many Nigerians drive to gas stations to buy kerosene that is subsidized with billions daily? None!. They buy from black market at prices way above the 'susbsidised price'.

Obi is wise to remove it from day 1 and re direct the inflated 6 trillion on subsidy to funding the Health Insurance, Education and infrastructure!

You don't pamper a crime, you severe it from the root yesterday not even immediately or ASAP.

Diesel was deregulated ( subsidies removed) and  the Nigerian economy ran on diesel until recently and became the 25 largest economy in the world in 2015. This was the narrative until recently corruption festered and got the better 

If Jonathan had been allowed to remove subsidy, we all would have been better for it today.

It doesn't make sense to sustain a scam in the name of subsidizing fuel when Nigerians can't get it to buy, but neighboring countries do.

The Petroleum industry bill as signed( another hall mark of Bubu after  the ammednded electoral act as signed) cannot operate while subsidies are been paid to determine prices.

The best time to remove subsidy is not ASAP or 3 months or in the near future, it should have been yesterday and if we all missed the opportunity to remove it yesterday, the next best time is DAY 1 of Obi's presidency!.

It takes guts, boldness to rule Nigeria and that is the kind of leader I want. Not one who will play politics with our problems for the sake of 'political correctness or diplomacy'.

He has our blessings and that of Labour to do the needful!

1/9/23, 8:06 PM - +234 806 092 4290: He can be assassinated, his "trusted" lawyers will either be paid off with billions not to release any incriminating evidences or assassinated as well. Our Nigeria politicians are desperate and most have already sold their souls to the devil. He and his family have to watch their backs
1/9/23, 8:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I don’t think this guy would have come out without a plan A, B, C and D. Of cos the line about possibly being assasinated is to pre-empt any such moves by Atikus team or sympathizers. 
Any attempt on him already detracts from Atikus already shaken potential at the polls.
1/9/23, 8:21 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: So for now… it is safe to say he is safe.
1/9/23, 8:22 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The elephant in the room remains, Why now? What’s the motivation? He suddenly became patriotic?

1/9/23, 8:27 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I get your points
1/9/23, 8:30 PM - +234 803 281 3842: And what if he has an ulterior motive ? The fundamental question is: Are the evidence real? If the man is speaking the truth,regardless of the motive, we should call it what it is...he is calling out a thief.
1/9/23, 8:32 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Always wondered why obasanjo has such deep-seated hatred for Atiku. The man is a criminal genius.
1/9/23, 8:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Smiles. None of this is really new bro. SPVs or whatever you call it. We have always known politicians use proxies to steal public wealth. What has been lacking is the efficient use of available evidence in a decrepit Justice system.
1/9/23, 8:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you ask me all those coming out to nail one person or the other are either doing so because they are privy to private information and observed the table manners of not speaking while eating.
1/9/23, 8:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: This is either a way to get back to the table or destroy the table in its entirety
1/9/23, 8:34 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In Nigeria evidence exists in surplus. The challenge is that evidence becomes leverage in politics by the powers that be. Case in point Doyin Okupes case. Can someone remind me again how many years ago Dasuki gate happened?
1/9/23, 8:35 PM - +234 806 092 4290: We all know Atiku is a "thief" and Tinibu is a "thief" if not a bigger one. The methods described in the video is not new. Most if not all politicians use company names they opened in the name of other people to get contracts, and in most cases embezzled the money
1/9/23, 8:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We have been calling out a drug baron and dealer for months now. Yet Kano shut down economic activity to welcome Alibaba and the 45 ……
1/9/23, 8:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Calling out in this country holds no water. We no Dey resign for this side of the Atlantic
1/9/23, 8:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Even your village people no go forgive you
1/9/23, 8:37 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Guilty or Not
1/9/23, 8:39 PM - +234 803 281 3842: I agree with you up to the point where you appear to insinuate that it should not provoke public outcry simply because" its not new".
Corruption exists in every society. That's acceptable fact. What is unacceptable is where a corrupt man is called out by his ex-companion, we begin to create leverage for the corrupt by analysing the motive of the man calling him out.
1/9/23, 8:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: The intent is not important here but the fact that we finally have proof like we have on Tinubu that Atiku is corrupt

There were always suspicions but here we have incontrovertible proof. It will probably not amount to much but it's good we now are sure
1/9/23, 8:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Excellent post Austin
1/9/23, 8:42 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Analysis should be on the facts of the evidence.  Are they true and substantial? If they are, then we must cry out for his due punishment.  The 11 commandment still remains" do not be caught "...we can bring the motive defence, when the thief has been caught.
1/9/23, 8:42 PM - +234 806 566 2895: 100%✅
1/9/23, 8:43 PM - +234 803 281 3842: **can't
1/9/23, 8:43 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You cannot entirely eliminate motive however you want to discuss this. It is a function of timing and circumstances or context. 
Again I refer to the stellar job done by the amiable David Hundeyin in exposing BAT. We sure did have public outcry.  I think my point is that Public outcry has become too weak a card for us to play bro. It doesn’t mean it should have its day in court. Until of cos it metamorphosis into the desired result we all want to see. A collective desire actioned in voting credible politicians
1/9/23, 8:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And you think that this proof is not yet with the authorities? Dey play
1/9/23, 8:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1/9/23, 8:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You guys really underestimate your security and intelligence organizations
1/9/23, 8:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We just have a lack of political will to cast out iniquity. Because all of the politicians are smeared
1/9/23, 8:45 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It doesn't matter

For posterity's sake, it's now public knowledge

The point is that regardless of the motive of the whistleblower, the man is still a criminal. This isn't a smear campaign, just facts
1/9/23, 8:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: An wuce wurin!!!
1/9/23, 8:46 PM - +234 803 281 3842: If you have done any job with security operatives, you would realise that the best way to get intelligence to apprehend criminal is usually from the ex-companions that have become disgruntled for whatever reason. It's only a man's company that can rat him out. And its only when the company is not in unity ,for whatever reason,that someone rats them out.
1/9/23, 8:48 PM - +234 803 281 3842: The reasons aren't our concern...our concern should be whether what he is saying is authentic.
1/9/23, 8:49 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You have began to insinuate motive
1/9/23, 8:49 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Again, it gives me a layer of appreciation for Peter obi...the man is shouting" go and verify " and they still haven't dug out dirt on him.. dirt that sticks, I mean
1/9/23, 8:50 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: There will always be space in the room for idealists, realists and every other opinion. May the country get to the peak of its potential
1/9/23, 8:50 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Only God judges motive ...the law should only judge action. Did he do it? If yes,let him face the jury.

1/9/23, 8:59 PM - +234 803 281 3842: And thats why we are in the problem we are in...Nobody fears being caught in Nigeria  because they know they can always use tribe,religion or political arguments to distract when they are caught. That's the in the core of Nigeria's wonderful corruption- No fear of punishment or retribution
1/9/23, 9:03 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Waiting for team Atrick- us to trick us in believing that was not his voice
1/9/23, 9:06 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Exactly. If these revelations are on Peter Obi, I can guarantee you, he will be arrested before day break. But for the "mighty" we can only hear, analyse on social media and go back to bed.

1/11/23, 4:47 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I hope he has recordings of AA saying he uses the SPV in funding his personal businesses and family activities, otherwise he will claim the money was used to fund the party. If we had a sincere and functional EFCC, this is the time to investigate that company, and trace how money came in and went out. I am certain Obasanjo and many of our past and present politicians in the system then will be roped in, not just AA. In a sane country, he should be disqualified from running this race.
1/11/23, 5:12 AM - +234 817 034 1232: This video is funny and revealing. 

The Pastor said a prayer "....May your children have the character and destiny of the candidate you are voting for in this election....". Shout Amen 

Many refused to shout Amen. Lol 

It shows how wicked human beings are. 

If similar statement is repeated by an Imam or a Chief Priest in a mosque or shrine; many of their followers will be silent like those in this church. 

On social media yesterday Obidients shouted Amen. 

But Atiku and Tinubu supporters got angry and started insulting the pastor. They felt attacked 🤣🤣 

We have close to 20 presidential candidates. Supporters of most candidates shouted Amen with confidence, with the exception of 2 candidates who were complaining about the video. 

If e sure for you and you get mind shout Amen na. Lol


A big Amen to this video.
1/11/23, 6:44 AM - +234 806 529 3872: This election is now a Must Win for Atiku cause if the doesn't win, he may Wind up in Jail for corruption!

1/11/23, 8:06 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Even if( very unlikely) he 'wins' he is already perceived stained and he would be 84 during the next election cycle and very unlikely to appeal to the majority of the demography of electorate. It's unfortunate for him that he is contesting at a time when the character, capacity, track record will be the most important variables that will determine who is president. In the past this may have been overlooked, as everyone is the same, but with PO in the picture, the dynamics have changed !
1/11/23, 8:52 AM - +234 806 957 3853: <Media omitted>
1/11/23, 8:54 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Do you really think "character, capacity and track record will be the most important variables that will determine who is president" in this election? If it were so, it would have been game over by now
1/11/23, 8:56 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You're still talking like this?🫤

That means you don't believe Obi has a chance
1/11/23, 8:57 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Those characteristics are important but saying the most important means Tinibu and Atiku don't have a chance
1/11/23, 8:58 AM - +234 806 566 2895: If Obi wins, doesn't that mean those were the most important variables?
1/11/23, 9:07 AM - +234 806 092 4290 changed this group's icon
1/11/23, 8:59 AM - +234 817 950 7218: All he's saying is that we hope that will be enough

But we know that the majority of votes cast in this election will be based on tribal and religious sentiment

Obi will get a lot of votes based on that as well

The hope is that there are enough who judge based on character and competence to tilt it in Obi's favor

But at least 51% of votes cast will be based on sentiment and not competence
1/11/23, 8:59 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We could say so by then. But if Tinibu wins will accept those were the most important?
1/11/23, 9:00 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Thanks bro. You have said it all
1/11/23, 9:00 AM - +234 806 092 4290: *you
1/11/23, 9:00 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I agree

My point is that if Obi wins, then character and competence ended up being the most important variables
1/11/23, 9:04 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Yes, that's when we can authoritatively say Nigeria's politics have changed from the usual norm to based on character, capacity and track records. Until then, we are only hoping, praying and playing our parts to ensure people vote not just wisely but rightly.
1/11/23, 9:07 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's still not true


If those were the key variables then he should have selected a southern and/or christian vice and seen if he'd be able to win

1/11/23, 9:08 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Happy birthday Jane C. Have a lovely day and many more happy years
1/11/23, 9:11 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I only addressed one statement by Omale, you seem to be considering previous ones. Because I'm struggling to get you. 

My point is this, if Obi wins, it means that the reasons for voting him were the most important, which were his character and competence.

These we know empirically are the reasons behind his support
1/11/23, 9:21 AM - +234 806 092 4290: "It's unfortunate for him that he is contesting at a time when the character, capacity, track record will be the most important variables that will determine who is president".
And you think that my response to Abiola is inappropriate because I believe in PO?
I asked you a simple question which you ignored. If Tinibu wins, will you still say the elections were based on those variables?
1/11/23, 9:21 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Apt
With the gross anger, disappointment and high undecided voters Atiku is unlikely to win even if All the NW and NE votes for him.

Even on the premise of religious and ethnic sentiments, you can't become president of the Federal republic of Nigeria if you can't convince the SW,SS,SE and NC to vote for you.

Again, for those in the north who voted Buhari based on religious and cult followership now make up a high proportion of those that are undecided in NW and NE. For these voters, they are not likely to make the mistake of voting on religious sentiments but on competence and who will get the job done.

You can't tell a family who sold lands and property as ransom, or farmers who can't go back to farms or mother's whose daughters were maimed and raped to vote on religious and ethnic sentiments.

Character, competence if before now didn't matter in previous elections, is now in the front burner
1/11/23, 9:25 AM - +234 703 102 6999: Happy birthday to you @Dr. Jane.
1/11/23, 9:26 AM - +234 803 614 5338: 💃💃
🎂🎂
🍾🥂
Wishing you many happy returns.
1/11/23, 9:26 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Tinubu can't win if he is not sure of winning Lagos first or sharing the SW. If he can't win the SE, SS,NC and the NW that will be shared by kwankwaso, Atiku, Obi and himself. He may do well in the NE by winning Borno and Yobe, but that won't make him meet the constitutional requirements to become president.

Dont forget the SW is not even sure for him as again his albatross will be the high undecided voters.

Don't forget even with his rigging machinery in Lagos in the 2019 elections, APC only won by over 100k votes, in a state that has 6 million voters and only 1.5 claimed to have voted. The dynamics now has changed and he is unlikely to win Lagos, even if he does only by a slim margin
1/11/23, 9:27 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Happy birthday Jane. God bless you immensely. Have fun but don't choke 😊
1/11/23, 9:27 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Character, capacity, competence and track records matter now more than ever before, but saying authoritatively that that's going to decide the next president of Nigeria is arguable. We are only hoping those variables will give us the edge. A lot of variables will decide the next president.
1/11/23, 9:28 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Oh ok. I see what you mean

What I am saying is that if Obi wins, it doesn't mean that Character and competence were the most important variables that determines who wins an election

There are many variables, character and competence would be one of them in this election.
1/11/23, 9:28 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Okay I understand you now👍🏿
1/11/23, 9:29 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Ok
1/11/23, 9:32 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We hope so. But from my own political understanding and what is currently going on in the different geopolitical zones, Tinibu has a better chance of winning than Atiku, with or without any revelation, and except "divinely" influenced, (as I personally believe more in), Tinibu may still have edge over PO
1/11/23, 9:33 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Unlikely he wins going by the feelers on the field. Atiku may displace him for second
1/11/23, 9:35 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You really believe these Nigerians are completely ready to fight for their future more than their present gains. We have more enemies of Nigeria more than it's friends, all within
1/11/23, 9:41 AM - +234 817 034 1232: This message was deleted
1/11/23, 9:42 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Tinubu is not in this race he is not a factor

The top contenders are Atiku  and Peter 


Atiku is relying on underage voters uploaded into computer system which will be read by the BVAS aided by Mahmood and Buhari 


Peter is relying on new voters and those who will decide it is no longer time to vote based on ethnic and religious sentiments 


The question is who will outvote who?
The trick is to turn out enmasse 

But it will be surprising if Tinubu wins...that will be the time to stop underestimating Nigerians capacity for outright consistent foolishness 

Let's watch out
1/11/23, 9:51 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Well, this is one interesting thing about politics. We all have our different views. I used to think the North will be fully behind Atiku but I have perceived that the North is largely behind Tinibu. Everyone is fighting for their interest and they don't see Atiku representing their interests. As bad as Atiku is, if we were left to choose between Atiku and Tinibu, I will go for Atiku, but I don't see Atiku beating Tinibu. Also, if you think majority of the west will not vote of Tinibu, think ago. Ethnic and religious sentiments are some of the major factors that will decide the presidency.
While this election is likely going to be based on number of votes casted, there are many ways to get votes on your favour. You mentioned one.
1/11/23, 9:53 AM - +234 806 566 2895: The West will shock you Omale, just wait😅
1/11/23, 9:53 AM - +234 817 034 1232: <Media omitted>
1/11/23, 9:55 AM - +234 806 092 4290: That shock is welcomed. That's what I am hoping. At least I will know that we have truly matured and arrived 😊
1/11/23, 9:59 AM - +234 817 034 1232: So you think the West will vote their son Tinubu

While the East vote their son Obi

Then expect the North to abandon their son Atiku??

This election will likely mirror 1979 election where Shagari came first
Awolowo second 
Azikiwe third

However we are counting on the fact that Buhari has brought so much destruction to human lives and economy to change the permutations 

The election will decide if we have learnt a lesson
1/11/23, 10:07 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The middle belt won't go got Shagari anymore

That's a key factor
1/11/23, 10:07 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Don't rule out kwankwassiya effect. It's not looking good for Atiku in the NW. 

NE will be split with Atiku, Tinubu and Obi likely to win 2 states each.

The NW has the highest voting population, but they also have the highest undecided voters in the country!. Another variable is with bandits forming micro govts and insecurity, voter apathy will be a factor( even if negligible. 1% percent of say 14 million is huge )

Now back to those who will be in the majority and vote. The younger( majority) demography in the NW is likely for kwankwaso, while  the elderly( lesser) will vote Atiku. Obi and Tinubu will likely share the 3rd and 4th positions, while Atiku and Kwankwaso battles for 1st and second.

So even if people vote for their son, what you forget is that some regions have two sons, and it will be which of the two can they trust in the NW to deliver
1/11/23, 10:08 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True
1/11/23, 10:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes

Kwankwaso will affect Atiku 

That's the only thing that may help Obi

Not ruling out that Kwankwaso may align with Atiku. The possibility is there
1/11/23, 10:15 AM - +234 810 006 7926: True, but I think there is a personal grudge with Kwankwaso feeling betrayed and he is not likely to listen to any elder. That is even if he doesn't do better than Atiku
1/11/23, 10:21 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Tinubu is unlikely to get less than 50% of the votes from the West. Obi will win SE and SS but lots of votes will go to APC and PDP as well. Apart from Gombe in NE, I don't see anywhere PO has a chance winning, including all of NW, we only hope he gets at least 25% in most of those areas. For me, PO's winning will depend largely on how massive he wins most of NC. Kogi state is a no chance for PO
1/11/23, 10:22 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Fair and practical analysis
1/11/23, 10:22 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The most important variable that might help Obi is religion

1 Christian versus 3 Muslims
1/11/23, 10:23 AM - +234 806 092 4290: <Media omitted>
1/11/23, 10:23 AM - +234 803 097 7516: When is the election sef
1/11/23, 10:23 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Help?
1/11/23, 10:24 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't forget the next variable : Tribe
1/11/23, 10:24 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Is something wrong with the word?

Help him win or get votes
1/11/23, 10:24 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol not the word. Not sure if it would really help
1/11/23, 10:24 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Obi will Gombe, Taraba and plus or minus Adamawa.

Don't forget when Atiku and Obi contested on the same ticket in 2019, if my memory does not fail me. Atiku lost his ward and won Adamawa by less that 50,000 voters. Obi won Anambra by at least 200,000 votes.This was 2019. 

Atiku is not even sure of winning Adamawa this time
1/11/23, 10:24 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup

Tribe will follow shortly

These are the things people will vote by

But most of the country don't charge tribe with any of the candidates
1/11/23, 10:25 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Lol🤣🤣🤣🤣you come vote?
1/11/23, 10:25 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's a key thing in NC

Religion

Many will vote along religious lines in that region and particularly against Muslim -muslim ticket
1/11/23, 10:26 AM - +234 806 092 4290: It is easier for a rich man to make heaven than Obi winning Adamawa. Taraba, yes, there's a slight chance
1/11/23, 10:28 AM - +234 810 006 7926: The Game changer is the NC( fortunately or unfortunately) when every region has voted based "religion? and tribe?" , they will decide who is president because  they don't have any candidate and will be unbiased!
1/11/23, 10:29 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Don't forget Atiku won Adamawa narrowly if I still remember clearly
1/11/23, 10:33 AM - +234 810 006 7926: So iF Atiku is from NE and he is splitting his votes into 3 , he is not likely to win NC,SS,SE,SW how can he meet the constitutional requirements to become president. Don't forget even NW which he is likely to win is very slim, with the region likely to be shared by Kwankwaso
1/11/23, 10:35 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Then, not now. Remember NE has never produced a president and they believe they have a better chance now than before. Adamawa is like Rivers state. When you go there, you can hardly see any other candidates poster than Atiku. There are few  LGAs there that I know that majority will vote for PO, but in general Atiku wins the state. Even APC don't have a chance there.
1/11/23, 10:38 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Not likely it is any different now with heightened anger by the electorates.Atiku won 10 LGAs, Buhari won 11 and Atiku won by only 34,000 plus votes.
1/11/23, 10:39 AM - +234 806 092 4290: The anger is against APC and Buhari now, not Atiku
1/11/23, 10:39 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Obi is likely to win Adamawa, even if he looses to Atiku it will be a narrow loss
1/11/23, 10:42 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Don't worry Omale Obi by Gods Grace is the next President of the Federal republic of Nigeria. Know this and know peace!
1/11/23, 10:54 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Let's hope so

1/14/23, 6:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *APC/PDP: The unholy exchanges of two unscrupulous candidates* 

The gods had Tinubu and Atiku in mind when they said remove the log of wood in your eye to see clearly and remove the speck in your brother's own. 

Tinubu has asked Atiku to come clean and publish his health records to Nigerian. 

Almighty redeemer; you warned us about hypocrites and their outward appearance. 

Tinubu has described Atiku as a man with shuffling gait. He called him handicap and a man needing assistance descending the stairs. 

Tinubu reported that Atiku is an unrepentant thief who used money to buy pants and houses for his numerous girlfriends. 

When a pot begins to call kettle black; we must begin to question if it has been washed by the owner. 

Tinubu of all people. 

He wants us to take his message and ignore him as the messenger. 

But Atiku has fired back. 

He says Tinubu suffers from Parkinsonism accompanied by urinary incontinence. 

Atiku replied that if Tinubu alleges he has a shuffling gait, then Emilokan must be exhibiting a Festinating gait and a postural sway. 

Yes. The two elderly candidates have gone medically nuclear.
We must invite the neurologists to settle this matter. 

Atiku further described Jagaban as man with failing memory, poor speech articulation and limb coordination problems. 

But Shettima has replied. He says Tinubu is healthier than him because he has diabetes and hypertension. 

Shettima the 'medical specialist' said Parkinsonism is a result of insomnia. We must consult our books again. 

An APC spokesman said sick people usually are the best presidents. So we should allow Tinubu to rule us. 
He even told us to go and verify from American presidents. 

God in heaven, heal your people physically. But please take your time to heal those who are mentally unwell– to the extent of defending the indefensible. 
Our God we know you can do this. 

Atiku further called Tinubu a drug dealer and as a custom officer blocked his illicit trades at the border. 

Two elderly candidates who should be at home retired have decided to wash their dirty linens in public and dance naked in the market square to the entertainment of the public.

1/15/23, 5:13 PM - +234 703 714 8734: The General Medical Council which licenses and maintains the official register of medical practitioners in the United Kingdom licensed at least 266 Nigerian doctors in June and July, 2022.

The implication is that at least three Nigerian doctors were licensed per day in June and July 2022 despite the moves by the Federal Government to stop the exodus of doctors and health workers in the country amidst worsening brain drain of the professionals in the country.

Our correspondent, who has continued to monitor the GMC register, noticed that the number of Nigeria-trained doctors in the UK currently stands at 9,976.

The figure does not include other doctors of Nigerian origin who did not undergo medical training in Nigeria.

First off, we need to all understand that politics has nothing to do with morals. It is a game of numbers and he who can manipulate the numbers and emerge with the highest of same takes the day. 

That said, don’t be surprised about anything you see in politics. Set your expectations low so you don’t end up being disappointed.
1/17/23, 8:28 PM - +234 806 675 1526: However my party and our presidential candidate, to my  current knowledge, have no plans of stepping down for anybody.

1/18/23, 7:36 AM - +234 806 675 1526: Pattie, he has more speeches like this, some even more telling. 

Unfortunately, Nigeria and it’s populace are a people easily swept away by the crowd mentality irrespective of the substance of the rave and the direction of the flow. 

Idealists metamorphose into realists, and realists remain ever evasive of the naked truth in the hope of achieving some ineluctable effervescent goal. In the end, both are disappointed. 

The candidate of the SDP isn’t made for a clime like this, no, he is made for enlightened populace who question the ideology behind every plan, policy and philosophy that influence their daily lives. 

Unfortunately, these are alien mannerism of reasoning to us. 

The good thing is this; we have been able to share with the world that we have in store pristine individuals replete with the requisite know-how to think completely differently from the norm and current practices. 

A new crop of politicians have sprang up and in no distant time, Nigerians, however long it might take, will come around. 

I will constantly send his interviews here so you can listen some more and be marveled. 

The idea is, for now, if only one person can be influenced by my candidate to vote for my party, then I would have achieved my goal here. 

Good morning.

Ok. But, seriously, you were the one that said politics is about numbers. Your candidate is most probably a credible option for Nigeria, but at this moment in our history, another credible candidate has numerical momentum. And I believe the reason is that PO has auditioned for a position in which he has some experience, while your candidate has no experience as a member of the executive arm of government in Nigeria.its not because we are not an enlightened population, sir. Talk is cheap, so we chose a good man with experience as a governor (and performed) over another good man who I would advise should go get some experience in a lower position in the executive arm of government, before pursuing his presidential ambition. Let's see him perform his noble ideas on the state level, and we can grow our confidence that he can replicate it on a national level....but,in the meantime,it makes sense for this great guy( ur candidate) to collaborate with another more experienced great guy. I am glad that you have clarified the fake news about your candidate wanting to collaborate with a great thief and ex-drug baron. That was refreshing.

1/21/23, 12:57 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Dear colleagues,

Greetings! As announced earlier our site application has been accepted for the certificate course *Leadership and Management in Health at University of Washington eLearning* . Next steps include the following:

1. Participant application
2. Payment
3. Running the course 

I will break these items into simple details for easy understanding and for prospective participants to fully know what to do and when to do it.
1/21/23, 12:57 PM - +234 806 675 1526: *PAYMENT*
 
Deadline for payment as a site is *20th March 2023* .

- Depending on our number, we are going to split the course cost of $999 among all the participants to know how much each of us will pay to make up the total sum, plus a token amount for bank charges to be incurred during payment on behalf of the group.
- The larger the number the lesser each participant would pay, so please let us encourage others to join including those who are not part of this class.
- There are currently only 30 persons who have indicated interest, we are targeting 60 persons which is the maximum for a single site.
- If we reach up to 60, each of us only needs to pay *$16.65* . Currently that we are just 30, each of us would pay *$33.33* ! *So let's push to reach 60!.*
1/21/23, 12:57 PM - +234 806 675 1526: *RUNNING THE COURSE* 

The course starts from *3rd April and ends by 18th June 2023.* 

- During the course, we would have opportunity for peer-to-peer learning where we can meet as a group online to discuss the course materials and to provide support to each other. 
- We will select facilitators among us to mentor and support the weaker ones among us and to have a lively and engaging learning process.

1/21/23, 4:40 PM - +234 806 329 9675: 😳
1/21/23, 4:44 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This course that UW has used to cash out on Nigerians 🙂
1/21/23, 4:45 PM - +234 806 675 1526: How them go do na? People wey need am Dey do am.
1/21/23, 4:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Well 'need am' is subjective. Not sure this particular one is a requirement for anything when there are similar and better cheaper ones
1/21/23, 4:48 PM - +234 806 675 1526: If those who are applying for this know about a better and cheaper one, I am sure they would go for it. Everything is all about information.
1/21/23, 4:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: You very right. My point is this
1/21/23, 4:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: To make a distinction with your certificate
1/21/23, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: There are two options
1/21/23, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't have a common one
1/21/23, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Or have an outstanding among the common
1/21/23, 4:49 PM - +234 803 097 7516: That's the idea that calls attention
1/21/23, 4:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: <Media omitted>
1/21/23, 4:51 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This is how you get attention
1/21/23, 5:28 PM - +234 806 675 1526: That’s right. Again, this is low budget and lots of people will do it not because they love it but because it is the opportunity that has presented.
1/21/23, 5:40 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The University of Washington courses are quality certificate programs @2348066751526 . The schools decision to allow more people access to the certificates by signing on as sites at a reduced feel collectively doesn’t in anyway water down the value. People who sign on as single students will still pay heavily. 

Understand that it’s also a way for the school to market its product cos even education today is a service delivered by various business models.
1/21/23, 5:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The question of common is very subjective actually. The fact that you know 10-20 people who have done a UW course doesn’t make it common actually.  The leadership and management in Healthcare program is only popular because every sector or unit of healthcare as well as personnel will at some point take on leadership or management roles OR be at the receiving end of same. Consequently, they are better positioned to critically assess issues or problem solve as the case may be. The ultimate winner will be healthcare
1/21/23, 5:47 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Let's catch up when free

1/21/23, 7:43 PM - +234 806 092 4290: OK. Thanks. Why voting in the first place, I thought it was already a done deal?
1/21/23, 10:24 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Is the medical negligence or a civil case?..

1/24/23, 6:01 AM - +234 806 092 4290: May God deliver us from these crooks. What we don't know is worse than what we know. Tinibu could even be worse than Atiku, if Tinibugate is opened.
1/24/23, 6:03 AM - +234 806 092 4290: My concern in all these revelations, why is he bringing out a private conversation between him and the SSA to Okowa? Did he consent to that? Is he not endangering the life of the SSA?
1/24/23, 6:07 AM - +234 806 092 4290: How does this conversation between them help in investigating Atiku or bringing him down? At least that of his daughter is still the same family, which his father will not do any harm to his daughter. For me this "revelation" of the private conversation he had with the SSA of Okowa is uncalled for and irrelevant.
1/24/23, 7:13 AM - +234 806 529 3872: That part is irrelevant. I guess he was trying to clear the doubt of those still doubting him despite earlier videos.
1/24/23, 7:55 AM - +234 806 566 2895: The guy collect better bar shaaaaaaa😂.

That's the only reason someone would betray confidences like this, demonstrating a total disregard for others safety

Quite interesting that he doesn't tell us who to vote, just regular demarketing. Tinubu must have paid quite a fortune

1/24/23, 8:41 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Told you guys that Tinubu exists to cancel Atiku,and Atiku survives to cancel Tinubu. This is the reason for their  mention and existence in our collective consciousness this season. Like a dot in a circle will they be forgotten swiftly!

1/24/23, 9:30 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Revealing!. Regardless of the motive or source of inspiration for this, Atiku is broke!. He spent all he had, buying dollars for over 1000 delagates, who he gave 10,000 dollars each. Now not just Okowa, Tambuwal has gone to get bonds/ loans for Sokoto state- in a bid to actualize the selfish interest of becoming the Senate president after supporting  Atiku to become president . He forgets that there is an unwritten rule that you can't become senate president by 'their own statutes' as a first term senator!

I have always suspected the 2nd tranche of loans Okowa was to get recently, was for campaigns while he is still owning pensions etc.

Atiku had always said a general gave him a name of the VP and woke said a general called him to threaten him. We now know who that general is. If Gusau can be cheap to be bought with 5 million dollars, it also says something. The Generals are broke! If I'm not mistaken, this same Gusau is suspected to fuel banditry in NW for selfish interest( a fmr NSA! ).

At least his daughter has made it clear you can't use money to buy genuine followership otherwise, Atiku would have beaten Yaradu, Gooddluck and Buhari, all whom he was 'richer' than.

Revealing how Achileaks gave us Atikugate, as Hundeleaks gave us court documents of Drugified rather than a BATified  APC candidate.

All these are happening for a divine reason many won't understand!

While I advocate we respect the office of the president of Nigeria, we must also understand there is a personality behind that office that must give account of requirements of that office!. Who is the personality of the candidates wanting to occupy the office of the president of Nigeria?

Moral of this video, the children you do not send to school and give jobs today, will pick up stones and stone you tomorrow even though they called you father yesterday!. Buhari made history as president with the highest no of out of school children and 
highest unemployment rates!

2/1/23, 3:51 PM - +234 806 921 7904: Happy birthday Oga Bulus. Enjoy your new age gracefully 💐🎉🎁
2/1/23, 4:36 PM - +234 803 281 3842: A pre-wedding picture shoot can be thrilling and enjoyable to plan. However, given that you need to come up with the greatest pre-wedding photoshoot ideas for 2023, it may also be tedious. When it comes to your pre-wedding shoot, you'll always want to attempt something fresh, and the greatest way to achieve this is to borrow a little bit of an idea from what others have done.

Will the real IPOB please stand up? 😅
2/3/23, 4:40 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I hope they stand up for the people and make sure the people's votes are defended
2/3/23, 4:42 AM - +234 803 310 4903: Happy Birthday brother Gyang
God bless and keep you
2/3/23, 4:42 AM - +234 806 092 4290: One thing I know is that the political crooks plan to use the miscreants amongst them to intimidate and scare people away during election
2/3/23, 4:47 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 🙄
Na their work be that?
2/3/23, 5:17 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup. That is for sure. But these are some of the things scarcity of naira should help as well
2/3/23, 5:19 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Because you need a lot of money for these things. Vote buying, hiring thugs, paying police

I hear Atiku is a little broke and Baba and his cronies don't want Baba blu
2/3/23, 5:20 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You are right but transfers can still be made
2/3/23, 5:24 AM - +234 817 950 7218: You can't really properly distribute transfers

Firstly transfer is easily traceable. Then even if you transfer to the main man
For effectiveness, be needs to convert to cash to pay the foot soldiers and thugs

Or to buy the votes in ground

It's a big battle going on

Tinubu is trying to get as much cash as possible and Buhari is trying to restrict as much as possible also
2/3/23, 5:24 AM - +234 806 092 4290: The problem with Tinibu and Co is that the kind of cash they have stocked illegally, even if they are 10m to the bank everyday to exchange for the new notes, it will take them at least a decade to finish them. It will limit their spending power but unfortunately, they have access to over 50% of the new notes, causing this extreme scarcity
2/3/23, 5:25 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yes
2/3/23, 5:25 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Transfer ??? 😂

So EFCC can track it?
2/3/23, 5:26 AM - +234 806 092 4290: That's the case. It's a war between two elephants, which is a welcome one, though it still affects the masses.
2/3/23, 5:28 AM - +234 806 092 4290: They have their ways. Who is EFCC? Has EFCC arrested those people openly spraying millions of the new notes? How many bank managers have been arrested for selling out the few CBN gave them for the masses?
2/3/23, 5:30 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Bros no dey too argue
Anyone who hasn't been arrested is because it doesn't matter to anyone now

But you leave a paper trail and tomorrow anyone who's in power and doesn't like you can use it to bring your downfall
2/3/23, 5:32 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's the joy of electronic money

The traceability

Most of them prefer cash.

Even Atiku as VP spoke about setting up pseudo companies to steal money. Moving money still requires some tact and what Bubu did was to make it harder

Not impossible but harder
2/3/23, 5:35 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You're quite right, politicians know this thing

They won't try transfer
2/3/23, 5:44 AM - +234 806 092 4290: But they use proxies
2/3/23, 5:45 AM - +234 806 092 4290: "Trusted" individuals where paid to go deposit old notes in the bank into their account and transfer to another account.
2/3/23, 5:46 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Sure, the current policy limits their power but does not stop it
2/3/23, 5:49 AM - +234 806 566 2895: When we say watch foreign films you go dey watch mount zion😜

See as this thing dey hard you accept?

We already said they set up shell companies but won't buy votes with those. It has to be cash and that level of money will be flagged
2/3/23, 5:54 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Apt!
2/3/23, 5:56 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Lol....
2/3/23, 5:59 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Na you dey argue blindly. What is difficult to understand? There will still be vote buying but it will be limited. That has been my point. If you think they will not be able to buy vote, then think again
2/3/23, 5:59 AM - +234 810 006 7926: My problem has been bank managers who has banked the politicians over and above the majority of Nigerians. Very soon the patience of Nigerians will grow thin, and they will start protesting and damaging bank property and burning down banks. I hope the bank managers are emotionally prepared for what they are up against!
2/3/23, 6:00 AM - +234 806 566 2895: That's not at all my point Omale

I just am saying they don't use transfers for such things
2/3/23, 6:02 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true

But CBN isn't printing enough, so bank managers can't carry bullion vans to politicians houses

They're controlling production strictly, this is also what's affecting the masses
2/3/23, 6:05 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Your absolutely right!

My fear, is the controlled little  CBN printing is not diverted via bank managers to the politicians at the expense of the people- who will now see new notes as a big deal and bargaining chip to sell their votes on that day
2/3/23, 6:07 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's the issue. Cash has become so scarce that vote buying might actually be more effective

That's the thing with some of these unknown side effects

You think it will do one thing and then next thing the effect turns out to be something else
2/3/23, 6:07 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Yeah your concerns are valid and it may well be happening but I think it's unlikely

Firstly, they aren't printing enough

Secondly, CBN is monitoring it strictly from what I hear
2/3/23, 6:08 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true

The extension of the deadline was idiotic and might provoke this very thing
2/3/23, 6:32 AM - +234 903 277 5777: <Media omitted>
2/3/23, 6:33 AM - +234 806 675 1526: Happy birthday sir
2/3/23, 6:49 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I agree with you, but when money has been transferred to the leaders of the thugs and coordinators of vote buyers at the grassroots through proxies, they will look for a way of paying some people. Some will embezzle the money without paying anybody, some will pay few, and cash out the remaining one. In Nigeria, "na who them catch be thief", so people will still take risk to get what they want.
2/3/23, 6:51 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Monitoring "strictly" you said? When we are seeing videos everywhere?
2/3/23, 6:55 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I see you left out the second part of my statement where I said "from what I hear"😅

Anyhow you like sha

My point is simple, politicians try to avoid paper trail. A friend of friend in DSS explained this to me, even NGOs do the whole cash thing when they fear doing something unsavory

I'm not saying vote buying won't happen. I'm saying you'll know it's working by how much Tinubu is wailing
2/3/23, 7:04 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Happy birthday MOG and a brother. 💃🏻💃🏻 God bless and establish the work of your hands
2/3/23, 7:29 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We are on the same point. We are hoping everything ends in favor of the Nigerians

2/3/23, 1:43 PM - +234 803 281 3842: This is true o..couldn't do any transfer yesterday.  Was at zenith bank today and the bank won't transfer from zenith to access bank.
2/3/23, 1:44 PM - +234 803 281 3842: The bank staff are hoarding the new naira notes and selling it to politicians.
2/3/23, 1:46 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Very true. It's a nationwide challenge
2/3/23, 1:46 PM - +234 817 950 7218: This is so funny
2/3/23, 1:47 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I sent Access to first bank today Sha

And GTB to unity bank
2/3/23, 1:49 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Our infrastructure and systems are failing. People are buying naira notes..2500 for 2000 naira notes.
2/3/23, 1:49 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Zenith is the main challenge. Two people had challenge sending from Zenith to my Access Bank. I send from UBA to different Banks. And I have sent from Access to GTBank earlier this week, after several attempts
2/3/23, 1:50 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Zenith bank now charges me 100 everytime I receive a transfer from another bank. Called it electronic transfer levy.
2/3/23, 1:50 PM - +234 803 281 3842: It's kangaroo Republic right now
2/3/23, 1:51 PM - +234 817 950 7218: We are going cashless. It's not an easy transition and our banks weren't prepared for the volume of virtual transactions to follow

But it's all for the good later on

I have had N500 in my wallet total this week

Used N100 to pump my tyre and I have N400 left

I've been living cashless

Maybe na Olopa go collect N200 this Friday evening remaining N200
2/3/23, 1:51 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Lord have mercy!🙏
2/3/23, 1:51 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Wow
2/3/23, 1:52 PM - +234 703 985 5168: 🤣
2/3/23, 1:56 PM - +234 703 985 5168: It's really gonna be a difficult transition in a  a setting & system like ours.
2/3/23, 1:57 PM - +234 806 566 2895: GTB sef
Fidelity na him dey try
2/3/23, 1:57 PM - +234 703 985 5168: ...where even novel interventions are embraced in a knee jerk style
2/3/23, 1:58 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I used transfer to buy 2k worth of goods, black market na transfer
2/3/23, 2:01 PM - +234 806 568 3004: We are going cashless by force. It is well
2/3/23, 2:02 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Anyway, In the long run we' be fine.
2/3/23, 2:04 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Sadly, it's a cow boy ride on a bull"....
2/3/23, 2:13 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I hope the president don't bow to the pressures on allowing old notes to be used concurrently with the new. Rather they should print more new notes and improve monitoring of the disbursement.
2/3/23, 2:17 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Don't worry. Once election is over the new note will circulate

You people should just endure small
2/3/23, 2:19 PM - +234 703 985 5168: I learnt from credible source...on BBC news that a sitting governor had 4mil of new notes delivered to him by a MDB.
2/3/23, 2:22 PM - +234 703 985 5168: My bro, the mechanism for monitoring is weak if there is any....
2/3/23, 2:22 PM - +234 703 985 5168: <Media omitted>
2/3/23, 2:23 PM - +234 803 281 3842: We don't have the infrastructure to support the policy. Small scale businesses are suffering  severely. We have epileptic power and poor Internet connectivity. The average speed of Internet connectivity in Nigeria is very slow..most of us have never seen a download speed of up to 10mbps, while developed countries have speeds of 50-200mbps (e.g Elon musks' starlinks).. so much infrastructural deficit limiting the policy
2/3/23, 2:23 PM - +234 803 281 3842: This is not the solution
2/3/23, 2:24 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Listen to this, though it was conducted in Vernacular....Hausa
2/3/23, 2:24 PM - +234 703 985 5168: These politicians, hmmm
2/3/23, 2:30 PM - +234 806 092 4290: It's happening life. The bank managers are culprits. The only difference is that they can't get as much as they would have preferred
2/3/23, 2:33 PM - +234 817 950 7218: We will never be ready until we start

Shey that's what they said about Jamb and CBTs in Nigeria

Shey we are now doing CBTs?

Transitions are never easy but sometimes they are necessary
2/3/23, 3:05 PM - +234 803 281 3842: The banks don't have capacity for cashless. I am standing in the zenith bank right now..they just announced that they don't have network. How do u do cashless, without connectivity? This is not jamb or cbt...lives and businesses are at stake here.  Imagine you just ate in an unfamiliar restaurant and no network to pay for your meal and ofcourse you don't have cash..or you have to pay for surgery? The banks don't even have proper tech support .

2/3/23, 3:13 PM - +234 703 509 5558: Na coins dem dey dispense for banks again?
2/3/23, 3:22 PM - +234 817 950 7218: It will get better

Shey Starlink has come now

Banks will key in soon

No more lack of connectivity
2/3/23, 3:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The mass exodus of the brains behind the tech network backbone have mostly relocated to Canada when the banks should have paid them more. Like Chinedu said, it looks appalling and artificial, because the politicians are trying to take advantage of the process. After the elections, you will be shocked, everything will revert back to normal
2/3/23, 3:37 PM - +234 803 281 3842: The core of any policy should be alleviating hardship of the citizens, not worsening it. The policy makers didn't think of how to  implement this policy in a seemless way, with minimal discomfort to the people? We tolerate hardship under so many guise, including " don't worry, it will get better".   Who would bear the loses that small business owners are encountering? It will get better, it will get better....that's how we endured 8years of buhari
2/3/23, 3:37 PM - +234 803 281 3842: <Media omitted>
2/3/23, 3:40 PM - +234 803 097 7516: This idea is good but the timing is bad. It is going to bring lot of hardship and enhance vote buying
2/3/23, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: They needed to put in place a strong and efficient mobile money before this whole thing
2/3/23, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Other countries have done this transition without any itch.
2/3/23, 3:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Everything in Nigeria just has to come in a package of hardship to citizens why?
2/3/23, 3:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This message was deleted
2/3/23, 3:44 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You have a point though. The intention of the policy may have been brilliant but the follow through in implementation as a bounce back from the populace is defective . It just shows any policy must figure the backend on the Nigerian people during implementation
2/3/23, 3:44 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Which kind music be this abeg? 🤣🤣🤣
2/3/23, 3:44 PM - +234 803 097 7516: As terrible as Zimbabwe ecocash was in place before all this idea of currency change and all
2/3/23, 3:45 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol so this is some old traditional Yoruba gospel tone 🤣🤣
2/3/23, 3:46 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Usually played with accordion
2/3/23, 3:46 PM - +234 817 950 7218: 🤣🤣
2/3/23, 3:48 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The sound use to be pathognomonic of one particular singer 🤣🤣 can't remember his name. Just same way you will know Asake's song once you hear the beat 🤣🤣
2/3/23, 3:49 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Sounds very interesting. The song just fits the video very well
2/3/23, 3:51 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The way the hardship caused by this currency change is going, if Buhari goes to any state, they will stone him again. People have left their daily business to go to look for fuel and cash? It's pathetic in most places

2/3/23, 4:24 PM - +234 806 092 4290: If he did, then he needs to be interrogated by DSS to mention the Governor and the bank manager that gave him the 500m. @2348065662895, enough to by votes at the grassroots in that state
2/3/23, 4:25 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But we know this is why they are hiding it
2/3/23, 4:27 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Thanks for sharing bro. If the CBN governor and the president can't order El-Rufai to mention names then they should forget any thing about "strict monitoring".
2/3/23, 4:30 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Yes, we know. That's why the common man cannot get the little cash available. The politicians will always find their way. Do you know how much that manager would have received in exchange for that 500m? Worse of it is that it was probably exchanged with old notes
2/3/23, 4:32 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Proof
No be tok
2/3/23, 4:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: And this was why CBN tried to bypass the banks, to go to the rural areas and directly swap the old notes,. Guess it was a drop in the ocean. The banks in connivance with the politicians are complicit
2/3/23, 4:44 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Shouldn't El rufai be bold enough and mention their names, even without been told?. For Aisha to share his rants on her SM handle, surely the 'cartel' exists, but it is obvious the naira policy was well intended by Buhari to 'attempt' to right the wrongs, and conduct the freest elections ever in our history.

The Cabal wants Atiku to be president and may just be a relative of Buhari who he holds in high esteem above his own wife. I have seen a picture of the CBN governor kneeling down to greet him. 

This election is a fight for Nigeria's survival. A fight between disgruntled citizens and the establishment/ cabals who are loosing relevance and coming to the lime light.
2/3/23, 4:46 PM - +234 806 092 4290: If APC or PDP wins, it is a loose loose situation for Nigerians.
2/3/23, 4:47 PM - +234 806 092 4290: He does not have that guts to mention names
2/3/23, 4:52 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Ooh bro, how I wish you understand Hausa very well....
2/3/23, 4:53 PM - +234 703 985 5168: He even bragged about it🤷‍♂️
2/3/23, 4:54 PM - +234 703 985 5168: " that we politicians know our ways"......of getting cash
2/3/23, 4:57 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Sir, remember that there are some "untouchables" as long there are with pack
2/3/23, 4:58 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Poor me....though I have listened to him complaining of sabotage from Aso Rock because of the new policy
2/3/23, 4:58 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I agree
2/3/23, 4:59 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Till the  cows come home nothing 's gonna happen to him

2/3/23, 5:01 PM - +234 810 006 7926: They can't. Even the cabal knows they have limits. The people's will will supervane
2/3/23, 5:01 PM - +234 810 006 7926: 👆🏼APC and PDP Politicians owning POS to vend cash on the d day
2/3/23, 5:06 PM - +234 703 985 5168: My dear brother, these politicians are hell bent.......to pursue Thier interest
2/3/23, 5:07 PM - +234 703 985 5168: Imagine a sitting governor bragging about it....." We know how to get cash"
2/3/23, 5:08 PM - +234 703 985 5168: That maybe one of a thousand plans they v   hatched

2/3/23, 5:36 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The Aso Rock cabals want Atiku
2/3/23, 5:41 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes they do, but unfortunately it is not enough to make him president!
2/3/23, 5:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: True. 

It's like the CBN Policy took them off balance, and they are only trying to get their feet!

This would be critical to its validity esp if the crude picture is in a way similar to what is obtainable Across Nigerias demographics.
2/5/23, 5:46 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Maybe add to that “income bracket” esp for a country with 130million people living below the poverty line

2/5/23, 10:20 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Hmmmm!
This poll doesn't fill me with optimism cos I don't think Obi gets the required 25% in at least 24 states
2/5/23, 10:23 PM - +234 703 505 6225: And that has been my fears @2348100067926 .
It looks like one of the crude predictions I made like two weeks ago that surprisingly puts PDP ahead to win this elections. 😀
2/5/23, 10:27 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Obi may get the popular votes but will have to push hard to get  the required 25% in 24 states.
His best chance of getting that is to push to get at least 25% in the SW states.For now, aside lagos, I am not sure of his strength there.
It is almost late for him to make in-roads in the NE and NW aside Kaduna in the NW and Adamawa and Taraba in the NE where he may get the required 25% percent
2/5/23, 10:36 PM - +234 703 505 6225: I think PDPs target will be to come a close second in states they may not win, get the spread and hope to win outrightly or at least qualify for the run off. 
APC may end up third.
2/5/23, 10:37 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Obi has a chance of winning if he can get at least 25% in the all the South West states.
2/5/23, 10:42 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He will have a good outing in the SW, he may come in a close second to BAT if not first. The only state in the SW which I'm sure he may do a sub 25% is Osun state and with the hardship currently going on a lot of decided voters  are changing their minds and undecided making up their minds for Obi. It's going to be a battle to the wires for BAT in the West.

Of the three candidates, it is rather BAT and Atiku that appears not to have the spread(25% in 24 states plus Abuja), only PO. Even in states Obi does not win he is projected to get at least 25% in them. And for states he wins, he starves the other two candidates of the 25% they would have needed to breath to survive.
2/5/23, 10:43 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Below is my crude, not scientific  predictions of where  each candidate can get 25% of votes
2/5/23, 10:43 PM - +234 703 505 6225: States where presidential candidates will get atleast the recommended 25%.
To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive a majority of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least 24 of the 36 states.
If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of states.

I did not count states where I queried the candidates ability to get the mandatory 25%
Final Verdict: looks like we may be heading for run-off except some candidates push to make in-roads in states they are not too strong.

Obi has to really push to qualify for a possible run off in my opinion. (Coming from an obedient)
2/5/23, 10:43 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Then great
2/5/23, 10:44 PM - +234 703 505 6225: If he can get 25% in at least 4 of the South West states, then the run off maybe between him and Atiku or he wins outrightly
2/5/23, 10:45 PM - +234 703 505 6225: This election will be so unpredictable
2/5/23, 10:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your right but PDP will find it hard to get 25% in the SW (distant third), SS( distant second), South East( distant second- sub20%).

The north Central looks like the region where they can pick at least 25% in one or two states 

So even if PDP wins All the NW and NE states, it is not enough to make Atiku president
2/5/23, 10:47 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Interesting,  I will sit to compare my predictions with the polls to see😀
2/5/23, 10:48 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Cos from the polls, it looks like Tinubu will come second in Bauchi. I  was generous to give Kwankwaso 😀
2/5/23, 10:49 PM - +234 703 505 6225: If that is the case, Tinubu may make the 25% in  24 states
2/5/23, 10:49 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Interesting times ahead
2/5/23, 10:49 PM - +234 703 505 6225: 😃😃😃😃
2/5/23, 10:49 PM - +234 703 505 6225: I pray Obi does well in the Southwest,  then he has a chance
2/5/23, 10:50 PM - +234 703 505 6225: If not, it may be really difficult for him
2/5/23, 11:02 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Here is what I think:
Who ever must become president must win majority of votes cast and have minimum spread of at least 25% in 24 states AND Abuja(a lot forget about this. Who ever wins Abuja is likely going to win)

Obi's projected pathway to victory.

Obi is going to win the SE( strong win of at least 80-90% and will starve the oda candidates of the minimum 25% in the 5 states).

Obi will win the six SS states with a relatively lower strength than the SE, with 70-80% of the votes cast. Again leaving his two opponents to split the remaining 20- 30%.- This will bring to 11 states where BAT and Atiku will likely not meet the minimum 25%.

Going to the SW, it's going to be between BAT and Obi with Atiku coming a distant 3rd position( Again starving Atiku of the minimum 25% in 4-6 states( total of 15-17 states not meeting with the 25%).
Lagos is likely to see more turn out than the 1.5 million it always returns per electoral cycle. Obi is likely to win Lagos narrowly, a state with 7 million voters. The flip slide is the possibility Tinubu wins which is also likely. Who ever wins Lagos between Obi and Tinubu will win by 35-45%, while the second will come closely with 35-40%.

Tinubu would likely win Osun state, and that may be the state he would win with the highest margin in SW. Atiku Obi may come in a distant second and third respectively .

For Oyo,Ondo,Ekiti,Ogun Peter Obi or Tinubu may win and who ever wins will win by 40-50%,while the second comes in with 40-45%. Atiku will come a distant 3rd and do a sub 25% in these 4 states.
2/5/23, 11:07 PM - +234 703 505 6225: I think you also agree with me from your analysis that Obi's fate will be determined in the South West
2/5/23, 11:09 PM - +234 703 505 6225: The difference is that I'm not as optimistic as you are of his chances in the Southwest cos PDP traditionally does very well in the Southwest. The margin of victory in the Southwest for APC has not been very wide
2/5/23, 11:10 PM - +234 703 505 6225: The Yorubas are some of the most sophisticated voters in Nigeria and you can really tell how it will go
2/5/23, 11:11 PM - +234 703 505 6225: One thing I am sure is that Tinubu will win all the Southwest states, who comes second will have a chance of winning or qualifying for the run-off if he does well elsewhere
2/5/23, 11:11 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Cannot *
2/5/23, 11:16 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Now for NC, Obi is projected to win Abuja,  Benue, Plateau by a moderate win of 40-50%

BAT will win Kwara,Kogi with moderate win of 35-40%

Atiku will win Niger with a strong win with at least 60%

Nassarawa will be too close to call. Whoever wins will win by 35%, while the second comes in a close with 30-35 win and the third 20-25% win.

Now who comes in second in the states not won primarily by the candidates is key
 
Obi will come second in Nassarawa, Kogi

Atiku will come second in  Kwara, Abuja plus or minus Nassarawa and come with a weak third in Plateau, Benue( bringing to 17-19 out of 36 states plus Abuja where he may not meet the minimum 25%)

BAT will come moderate second in Plateau, Benue(20-25%) plus or minus Nassarawa.
2/5/23, 11:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Not likely! If it were in the days when he controlled the 6 SW states and their govs, your position may be true. It is also possible he wins SW but narrowly. Don't forget he may not win Lagos. In 2019, in a state of over 6 million voters less than 1.8 m voted and after rigging APC won by only 120k votes. With BVAS now, and more Lagosians coming out to vote, he is not sure of winning Lagos. And the same can be said in Ogun, Ondo, Ekiti and Oyo.

He has been digging his grave lately and they are many protest votes. Do not forget the stoning and breaking into banks, chasing him away from ilesha from the Oba's palace has all been from the SW.

Yoruba's are very careful, as they know it takes more than been sophisticated to see beyond the lines. No Decent Yoruba family wants to be told his or her son will spend 8 years in University instead of 4 years. No decent family wants to have their head deal with drugs, and I'll health.

There are many Undecided voters in the SW and many hide under this guise, so they don't get insulted for saying they are voting for someone else.
2/5/23, 11:47 PM - +234 810 006 7926: For NE, is another region Atiku will win but not convincingly. PO may even win his state Adamawa. Don't forget in 2019, Atiku lost his polling Unit! He won Adamawa overall with 38k votes in an election were rigging was rife!, while as VP candidate, Obi won Anambra for PDP with 400k votes). Obi may win Adamawa with a narrow win!. Whoever wins Adamawa between Obi and Atiku will be a narrow win. BAT will come a distant third( a sub 25%).

Obi may win Taraba with a moderate win and Atiku coming second.

Tinubu will win Borno, and Yobe. Atiku  will come a close third and Obi will come a distant 3rd but with double digits of 10% .

Atiku will win Bauchi and Gombe with strong wins, 

For NE Overall, Atiku will have the most votes cast,  followed by Obi and Atiku Atiku will for a first get a minimum of 35-40% of votes cast in All 6 NE states, but his loosing 4 states out of a possible 6 will only improve the geographical spread of Obi( minimum  of 35-40 % in Adamawa and Taraba)and BAT( minimum of 35-40% in Borno and Yobe)
2/6/23, 12:05 AM - +234 810 006 7926: For NW

Atiku will win at least 4- 5 states of Jigawa( best showing) Zamfara,Sokoto, Kebbi, 

Atiku's challenge will be in the K- states where he would meet a stiff opposition in Kaduna, Kano, Kastina.

Kaduna is likely to be split into 4 parts with each candidate sure of at least 25% of votes cast. Whoever wins will win with the lowest margins in the country of 25-30%. Second will come in closely with 23-27%, third and 4th 20-25% respectively.

While in Kano, Kwankwaso may win by 25-30%, Tinubu may come in second with 23-27%, Atiku third with 20% and Obi less than 15%.

Kaduna is going to see the reverse with Obi in a narrow win followed by Atiku, Kwankwaso. And BAT.

Kastina is likely to be won by Atiku, Kwankwaso, Obi and BAT in that order.

In summary while Atiku may win majority of the votes in NW and NE, he may not meet the geographical spread in the NC, SW,SS, SE.

BAT may win southwest with Obi breathing down his neck, but he may not meet the minimum 25% in the SS,SE, NC even though he will have a good show in Two NE state of Borno and Yobe.

Obi will have strong head wins in SE,SS with at least 80-90%,SW SW(40-50%), NC 35-45% with a minimum of 25% in Taraba and Adamawa. He also may do well in Gombe!
2/6/23, 12:31 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Not likely. Even if he wins 25% in All 7 NW states and 6 NE states, 25% of 6 SW states and 2-3 states in NC, he can't still meet the requirements for 24 states!
2/6/23, 12:38 AM - +234 810 006 7926: With this makes it highly likely Obi wins by the popular votes and geographical spread of a minimum of 25% in 24 states AND Abuja making him likely the 16th President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (POTFRON-16) ceteris paribus!
2/6/23, 3:44 PM - +234 810 006 7926: https://twitter.com/omoelerinjare/status/1622536623224143872?t=AJDYBjBev5K1eQDNNPcw0Q&s=08
2/6/23, 3:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This is plausible but Obi likely to be a close second ( if not first) in the SW with Atiku a distant 3rd( sub 25%).

So if you minus 6 SW states  from 28 where you projected Atiku to be second and get at least 25% of total votes cast, it will bring Atiku down to 22 and take Obi to 27 states when you add 6 SW where he will either come second or first!

The SW are not comfortable with the corruption tag, Age and the fact he had a froisty relationship with Obj associated with Atiku and he does not appeal to the SW.

Unlike previous elections, where the party was just enough, now it is the candidates behind the party tickets the SW looks at.
2/6/23, 4:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Did you remember that OBJ struggled politically in the Southwest during his 1st and 2nd tenure as president despite not having as much baggage as BAT? In fact OBJ did not win his own state. I will tell you for free that Tinubu will not have an easy ride in the Southwest. The Southwest is not politically naive. They will not buy Tinubu with his excess baggage. Peter Obi will stun Tinubu in the Southwest. Peter Obi’s coming.
2/6/23, 4:15 PM - +234 810 006 7926: - Shehu Gazali Sadiq
2/6/23, 7:12 PM - +234 706 815 1299: Correct 💯

2/6/23, 7:14 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Hasn't Kwankwaso stepped down yet?

2/6/23, 8:56 PM - +234 703 505 6225: He will not.
2/6/23, 8:57 PM - +234 703 505 6225: Very possible considering this poll is putting obi first in some of the SW states.

2/7/23, 11:22 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Is Nigeria going cashless or she at the brink of total collapse?

The things that are currently unfolding should be worrisome to all.

Is the the current situation with the currency really for the good of the nation or is it a cash grab? 

It certainly feels like the latter. 

Nigeria is being plundered right before our eyes and I am not talking about the slow burn corruption that we have become accustomed to. I am talking about the type of plundering that occurs right before a nation is officially sanctioned as a failed state. The powers that be are in the “let’s-grab-all-we-can-before-it-all-comes-crashing” mode.

Many of the politicians are already prepared for the worst. They have stolen billions to last generations, their kit and kin are safely nested in other countries, and I even hear that even the president’s wife is domiciled in Dubai.

Money is scarce to the general public, but it is available and is exchanging hands at an alarming rate but only in a certain direction. 

Do I also have to mention the fact that the populace is growing restive with every passing day or that the government has lost its ability to effectively govern and enforce law and order? 

As for our sovereign territory, we are fast loosing it. 

I mean, don’t we see all these things??? 

At this point, I am just worried
😟

2/8/23, 1:44 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I must admit, my support for Buhari coming into power was not a waste after all. I just travelled down from Abuja to Makurdi smoothly with dualized road, after a very long time.
2/8/23, 1:44 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The 16 years of PDP never remembered us this way.
2/8/23, 1:45 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I still believe if Buhari was healthy, this country would have had good success under his reign.
2/8/23, 1:46 PM - +234 806 092 4290: More reason we don't need someone that's worse than Buhari health wise to take over again
2/8/23, 2:06 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Like for real?
2/8/23, 2:07 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Buhari was only sick for two of eight years
2/8/23, 2:07 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Are you kidding me
2/8/23, 2:07 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Then you still don't understand why it shouldn't be Tinubu
2/8/23, 2:07 PM - +234 803 097 7516: If health is your reason for justifying Buharis failure
2/8/23, 2:11 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The remaining 6 of the 6 years, he is only apparently healthy in the body but not upstairs
2/8/23, 2:13 PM - +234 806 092 4290: There are many reasons why Tinibu shouldn't come, but whether a government will be bad or not, let it be that he was the one taking key decisions that he can be held accountable
2/8/23, 2:13 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Because of one road? 

Omale

Kai!
2/8/23, 2:16 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Fulani herdsmen
Multiple killings
Incessant kidnapping
Devastated northern Nigeria
Economic collapse
Education debilitation
Sky high inflation
Brain drain

But the world is alright since you travelled to Makurdi on a dualized road

Wow! Just wow
2/8/23, 2:17 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Says who
2/8/23, 2:19 PM - +234 803 097 7516: He couldn't take decision including Lekki toll gate
2/8/23, 2:22 PM - +234 806 092 4290: It's not just one road. If you have passed through Gombe-Jalingo Road through Savanna, Adamawa previously, then you will know that Buhari has touched places that were abandoned by even the "sons of the soil"
2/8/23, 2:24 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But why isn't south able to say same
2/8/23, 2:25 PM - +234 806 092 4290: These are the ones I passed through myself, not hearsay
2/8/23, 2:26 PM - +234 803 281 3842: This is a stupendous use of state's resources. All the states are APC states, in an APC federal government. Those lawyers will be paid with state funds and later they will claim the state has no money to pay workers. How does the state benefit from the non implementation of the new naira design?
2/8/23, 2:27 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Need to rig
2/8/23, 2:27 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The chief Justice na APC too
2/8/23, 2:27 PM - +234 806 092 4290: These became worse than previous years, but not new to us
2/8/23, 2:29 PM - +234 803 281 3842: I tell you...its laughable. 
Why didn't they start the suit back in November when cbn announced the redesign? Na now their eyes open?
2/8/23, 2:30 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Why not bring their strong points to federal executive Council meeting?.. whobis deceiving who?
2/8/23, 2:31 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I don't know if it doesn't exist. You cannot completely say because you have not passed through most roads in recent years
2/8/23, 2:32 PM - +234 806 566 2895: As in eh

Omale's conclusion is so faulty and I believe when he gives it some thought he'll see why
2/8/23, 2:33 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Omale keep justifying your decision to vote the worst leader this country has ever had

As long as you sleep well at night
2/8/23, 2:33 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Those that partook in those decisions are the emilokans
2/8/23, 2:33 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And they are bigger than the president abi
2/8/23, 2:33 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Lol
2/8/23, 2:33 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Bros you are justifying mediocrity
2/8/23, 2:33 PM - +234 806 566 2895: I have through most I'll tell you nothing has been done

What about Enugu Makurdi road?
2/8/23, 2:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Will your employer say stay on the job, it's ok to fail cos you are sick
2/8/23, 2:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Or would you as an employer tolerate buhari performance in your company
2/8/23, 2:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: If your answer to the two above are yes
2/8/23, 2:35 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Then I will understand your argument
2/8/23, 2:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Omale wallahi you should learn to admit and say, 'at the time it seemed I made a good decision but in hindsight it was bad'

That is humility if you don't know
2/8/23, 2:35 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Atoh
2/8/23, 2:36 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Which we all do. What matters is whether we learned in it
2/8/23, 2:37 PM - +234 806 566 2895: With everything in this country, bros Waka dualized road begin dey smooch himself say him use him PVC wella

E get where you go tok this thing boys go panel you well😅
2/8/23, 2:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: And by the way, check up the meaning of defensible decision
2/8/23, 2:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: A decision is as good and relevant as at the time it was taken
2/8/23, 2:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Not necessarily the outcome it bring
2/8/23, 2:38 PM - +234 806 566 2895: My brother not all of us do  obviously.

Omale no wan learn o
2/8/23, 2:38 PM - +234 803 097 7516: If you do a cutdown and still no access. Doesn't mean the decision to do a cutdown was wrong
2/8/23, 2:38 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Enugu to Otukpo Road was the first this administration did. And also was doing Otukpo down to Alaide. I haven't passed there for a while so can't tell
2/8/23, 2:39 PM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
2/8/23, 2:39 PM - +234 806 092 4290: These were roads that we had senate president for years without impact
2/8/23, 2:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Na why you suppose no shout. I traverse that road each Christmas 

They've been working on that road for 5 years and it's still a disaster.

Like everything this administration does, they never see anything through
2/8/23, 2:41 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I have traveled fairly round the country recently. Not as much as Rowland

Only Nassarawa has good roads and I strongly suspect it is influenced by the state government

Because the portion I cross nassarawa to Benue state the road becomes bad

Don't know if that has changed in the past year.

Benue roads have remained horrible. Same as Eastern roads

Of course insecurity and kidnapping wouldn't even allow most of us see other roads anymore
2/8/23, 2:41 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Keep excusing
2/8/23, 2:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: What is surprising you? Maybe not complete Enugu, but from Otukpo down to one area where you divert to the left is a smooth road. Before the administration, Otukpo to even Otukpa was a mess
2/8/23, 2:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: PDP never did better
2/8/23, 2:43 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Stop diverting, I never said PDP did better
2/8/23, 2:43 PM - +234 817 950 7218: To the best of my knowledge Benue state has horrible roads all round


And I pass it steady to go to the east. At least as at last year I passed it.

Plateau roads are fair but not great.

Nassarawa roads are very good

Benue roads are horrible

Enugu roads have some good and bad

Anambra na village road we dey use waka
2/8/23, 2:44 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Yes, Benue Road has been horrible, and the changes I have seen today is an evidence based testimony
2/8/23, 2:44 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Almost all federal roads in the south east are bad

South south try small and that's because of NDDC

Benue has horrible roads, Nassarawa manageable
2/8/23, 2:47 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Most of the Benue roads have been horrible for ages, and I am now testifying based on what I have seen. I will still go down to Ogbadibo this weekend and I will see the level of progress or deterioration the roads are
2/8/23, 2:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Okay. I last used it about a year ago
2/8/23, 2:48 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Remember to count the good and bad and give us an objective report
2/8/23, 2:49 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I am not diverting. I am speaking facts. I did not say this government has fixed all the roads in the country. I only mentioned places that were never remembered in time past but got a touch by this government. Any areas untouched have right to agitate and condemn the government. I have been critical of this government and I will praise him where he has done well
2/8/23, 2:50 PM - +234 817 950 7218: One thing I know is that the government was facing a recession with the crude oil collapse

They also had a lot of debt to deal with and money for infrastructure was hard to come by

So perhaps with the stabilization of the economy they might have tried a few things

I don't know

I know that I always liked Fashola and believed in his abilities

If there is anything done in roads and works, I'd give Fashola credit and not PMB
2/8/23, 2:50 PM - +234 817 950 7218: There's also the second Niger bridge which is commendable
2/8/23, 2:53 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Also if you are going from Abuja to Enugu now, you don't even need to pass Makurdi. You are guaranteed good road through Keffi Oweto to Otukpo, through Adoka and from Otukpo to that diversion I couldn't remember the name to Enugu. That diversion was from the Enugu state government of previous regime
2/8/23, 2:53 PM - +234 806 092 4290: 😃No worries
2/8/23, 2:54 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Yes..I heard about that road. A little isolated

Is it a federal road? Was it Buhari that did it?
2/8/23, 2:54 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Yes, it is a federal road started by the previous administration but completed by Buhari
2/8/23, 2:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: How many km is the road in question
2/8/23, 2:57 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I just told you I travelled from Abuja to Makurdi with roads dualized all through with works still in progress, as some areas where they need to demolish are isolated
2/8/23, 3:17 PM - +234 803 692 8469: 😳😳😳.

Wonderful.

2/10/23, 10:30 PM - +234 803 693 5215: *HOW TO SURVIVE THIS CURRENT SITUATION IN NIGERIA*

1. Don't take it personally, it's a general problem affecting everybody. Don't go and be displaying your nakedness in the bank, those who did didn't get shishi.

2. Suspend all your projects for now until things normalize. Don't kill yourself because you have set a target for yourself.

3. The most important thing now is feeding and health. It's not bad if you touch your savings at this time to survive.

4. Reduce going about to places that are not very important. 

5. Stop the unnecessary show of affluence and you don't have to impress anyone now. If you cannot maintain your standard please reduce it for now. If you don't eat meat this time you won't die.

6. Avoid bad and shocking news if you can, especially if you already have high blood pressure. Instead listen to good music, watch comedies and laugh out stress.

7. This is not the time to forsake God or get discouraged in serving God. In fact this is the time to serve God more. But avoid going to strange places, prayer houses, prophets etc for help.

8. Live responsibly and ensure you have a good health.

9. Above all, Remain Positive and God will see us through.

2/14/23, 8:31 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Is it only ibos voting Obi in Lagos.

Don't forget Buhari became president not because 15 million Nigerians voted for him. It is because 65 million Nigerians decided not to vote. Lagos state in 2019 had over 6 million voters with less than 1.8 million coming out to vote. Now it is over 7 million from the surge from young voters who will be voting for Obi.

Even Tinubu knows it is almost impossible to win Lagos.

Lagosians are tired of the Agbero's who have grown wings under their god father tinubu and tax people who are barely surviving. It's gotten to the neck for Lagosians who will be trooping out( both 4.5 million who didn't have a reason to vote in 2019 and the new 1 million voters- There is a strong likelihood voters turnout will be the highest in our country in the 2023 elections.

2/16/23, 8:05 AM - +234 806 092 4290: NATIONAL BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT, FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENCY SWAP AND STATE OF THE NATION, ON 16th FEBRUARY, 2023

My Dear Compatriots,

          I have found it necessary to address you today, on the state of the nation and to render account on the efforts of our administration to sustain and strengthen our economy, enhance the fight against corruption and sustain our gains in the fight against terrorism and insecurity which has, undoubtedly, been impacted by several internal and external factors.

2.      Particularly, I am addressing you, as your democratically elected President, to identify with you and express my sympathy, over the difficulties being experienced as we continue the implementation of new monetary policies, aimed at boosting our economy and tightening of the loopholes associated with money laundering.

3.      Let me re-assure Nigerians, that strengthening our economy, enhancing security and blockage of leakages associated with illicit financial flows remain top priority of our administration. And I shall remain committed to my oath of protecting and advancing the interest of Nigerians and the nation, at all times.   

4.      In the last quarter of 2022, I authorised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to redesign the N200, N500, and N1000 Nigerian banknotes.

5.      For a smooth transition, I similarly approved that the redesigned banknotes should circulate concurrently with the old bank notes, till  31 January 2023, before the old notes, cease to be legal tender.  

6.      In appreciation of the systemic and human difficulties encountered during implementation and in response to the appeal of all citizens, an extension of ten days was authorized till 10th February, 2023 for the completion of the process. All these activities are being carried out within the ambit of the Constitution, the relevant law under the CBN Act 2007 and in line with global best practices.

7.      Fellow citizens, while I seek your understanding and patience during this transient phase of implementation, I feel obliged to avail you a few critical points underpinning the policy decision. These include:

a.           The need to restore the statutory ability of the CBN to keep a firm control over money in circulation. In 2015 when this administration commenced its first term, Currency-in-Circulation was only N1.4trillion.

b.           The proportion of currency outside banks grew from 78%in 2015 to 85% in 2022. As of October 2022, therefore, currency in circulation had risen to N3.23 trillion; out of which only N500 billion was within the Banking System while N2.7 trillion remained  permanently outside the system; thereby distorting the financial policy and efficient management of inflation;

c.           The huge volume of Bank Notes outside the banking system has proven to be practically unavailable for economic activities and by implication, retard the attainment of potential economic growth;

d.           Economic growth projections make it imperative for  government to aim at expanding financial inclusion in the country by reducing the number of the unbanked population; and  

 

e.           Given the prevailing security situation across the country, which keeps improving, it also becomes compelling for government to deepen its continuing support for security agencies to successfully combat banditry and ransom-taking in Nigeria

 

8.      Notwithstanding the initial setbacks experienced, the evaluation and feedback mechanism set up has revealed that  gains have emerged from the policy initiative.

9.      I have been reliably informed that  since the commencement of this program, about N2.1 trillion out of the banknotes previously held  outside the banking system, had been successfully retrieved.

10.    This represents about 80% of such funds. In the short to medium and long terms, therefore, it is expected that there would be:

a.   A strengthening of our macro economic parameters;

b.   Reduction of broad money supply leading to a deceleration of the velocity of money in the economy which should result in less pressures on domestic prices;

c.   Lowering of Inflation as a result of the accompanying decline in money supply that will slow the pace of inflation;

d.   Collapse of Illegal Economic Activities which would help to stem corruption and acquisition of money through illegal ways;

e.   Exchange Rate stability;

f.     Availability of Easy Loans and lowering of interest rates; and

g.   Greater visibility and transparency of our financial actions translating to efficient enforcement of our anti- money laundering legislations.

11.    I am not unaware of the obstacles placed on the path of innocent Nigerians by unscrupulous officials in the banking industry, entrusted with the process of implementation of the new monetary policy. I am deeply pained and sincerely sympathise with you all, over these unintended outcomes.

12.    To stem this tide, I have directed the CBN to deploy all legitimate resources and legal means to ensure that our citizens  are adequately educated on the policy;  enjoy easy access to cash withdrawal through availability of appropriate amount of currency; and ability to make deposits.

13.    I have similarly directed that the CBN should intensify collaboration with anti-corruption agencies, so as to ensure that any institution or person(s) found to have impeded or sabotaged the implementation should be made to bear the full weight of the law.

14.    During the extended phase of the deadline for currency swap, I listened to invaluable pieces of advice from well meaning citizens and institutions across the nation.

15.    I similarly consulted widely with representatives of the State Governors as well as the Council of State. Above all, as an administration that respects the rule of law, I have also noted that the subject matter is before the courts of our land and some pronouncements have been made.

16.    To further ease the supply pressures particularly to our citizens, I have given approval to the CBN that the old N200 bank notes be released back into circulation and that it should also be allowed to circulate as legal tender with the new N200, N500, and N1000 banknotes for 60 days from February 10, 2023 to April 10 2023 when the old N200 notes ceases to be legal tender.

17.    In line with Section 20(3) of the CBN Act 2007, all existing old N1000 and N500 notes remain redeemable at the CBN and designated points.

18.    Considering the health of our economy and the legacy we must bequeath to the next administration and future generations of Nigerians, I admonish every citizen to strive harder to make their deposits by taking advantage of the platforms and windows being provided by the CBN. 

19.    Let me assure Nigerians that our administration will continue to assess the implementation with a view to ensuring that Nigerians are not unnecessarily burdened. In this regard, the CBN shall  ensure that new notes become more available and accessible to our citizens through the banks.

20.    I wish to once more appeal for your understanding till we overcome this difficult transient phase within the shortest possible time.

21.    Fellow citizens, on the 25th of February, 2023 the nation would be electing a new President and National Assembly members. I am aware that this new monetary policy has also contributed immensely to the minimization of the influence of money in politics.

22.    This is a positive departure from the past and represents a bold legacy step by this administration, towards laying a strong foundation for free and fair elections.

23.    I urge every citizen therefore, to go out to vote for their candidates of choice without fear, because security shall be provided and your vote shall count.

24.    I however admonish you to eschew violence and avoid actions capable of disrupting the electoral processes. I wish us all a successful General Elections.

Thank you for listening. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

2/17/23, 1:38 PM - +234 806 529 3872: *About Supreme Court And Their Interim Order Against The CBN - Facts and Falsehoods.*
//////////////////

I’ve seen lots of misleading information being peddled by some print media. 

They’re claiming that the earlier Interim Order by Supreme Court still subsists and operates as injunction against the CBN.

By their own logic, the old Naira note is still valid and legal tender, due the interim order of the Supreme Court.

Well, I don’t know how best to explain the life span of Interim Orders to non-lawyers 

But let me try.

An Interim Order is usually given to last for 7days.

And renewable after expiration of 7days, upon application for renewal.

Interim orders are quite different from the Interlocutory Injunctions.

Interlocutory Orders are made to last throughout the duration of the case, no matter how long the case may last in court.

The nature of the Supreme Court order against the federal government or CBN is;

Interim Injunction.

Duration is 7days.

As at today, that order has expired.

It expired by effluxion of time.

The Supreme Court sat today 

The review all the facts before it, but REFUSED to renew their already expired Interim Order.

The Plaintiffs, knew the interim order has expired

They tried to get the Supreme Court to approve renewal for them

But, the Supreme Court vehemently rejected their application for renewal, but rather adjourned the case for 22nd of February for further proceedings.

The legal and natural implications of this scenario is that;

there’s absolutely no further Order restraining the CBN from going ahead with its plans, decisions, and full implementation of its new rules and policies in accordance with its constitutional duties.

Concomitantly, the deadline for the old Naira notes remains irreversible.

What it means is that; there’s no legal impediments, no obstacles or restrictions against the CBN from enforcing its rules about the use of the new Naira.

Take a peep👇🏻

Read the whole revelation below:

There is a sitting Governor, who seriously crying more than other Governors in Nigeria, over the current Naira redesign policy.
So i decided to dig a little, to know if there are other reasons, why he is crying more, outside politics. 
What i discovered is truly shocking.
I discovered that this governor is under heavy pressure from bandits, over the naira redesign policy. Because all the billions they made from kidnapping ransom, is now useless in their hands. They are threatening the gov with massacre, if he allows their billions to be useless.
After paying the bandits free money for sometime, for doing nothing in Nigeria, the governor couldn't sustain the payment, and the bandits refused to go. That led to quarrels, that scattered the relationship with this governor and his armed ethic brothers, from other countries.

Some left, while some joined other willing tools like them, who are Nigerian, to venture into banditry, cattle rustling, Kidnapping, & all sorts of crimes.
They later become a thorn in the flesh of this said governor.
His state became the headquarters of kidnapping in Nigeria.

These bandits used his state as safe heaven, as they attack and kidnap at will. They did some high profile kidnappings, which generated billions of naira for them in ransom.
Different bandit groups.
With this new naira redesign policy, 80% of their ransom cash, is now useless.
The governor who knows that those bandits, had made billions from kidnapping, which stopped their financial burden & stress on him, is scared of their threats.
He is now fighting federal govt, to allow the use of new & old note until whenever all the old notes are retrieved.

He is masquerading with politics,
crying more than the presidential candidate of his party uncontrollably, even more than every other governor in Nigeria, that his people are suffering. while behind the scene, he is fighting for bandits not to lose their blood gotten ransoms.
He even went further to ask his people to spend, & use the old naira notes, that after his party candidate wins the election, he will upturn the naira redesign policy.
That message was actually directed to bandits & kidnappers not to worry. That he will secure their ransoms.

He threatened banks, to revoke their C of O, if they don't accept the new old naira notes.
He has directed government departments and agencies, to accept the old naira note for businesses.
He has threatened his state citizens with arrest, if they refuse the old naira notes.

Nigerians should ask this governor, what is his business with kidnappers and bandits.
Why is there too much blood shed in his state.
Since the new naira redesign policy started, Kidnapping has reduced almost to zero percent, in his state, and this governor is not happy.

Because it's like his people in the underworld, are currently unemployed.
This governor is using politics to make noise, go to radio, & TV stations, even headed to court over the new naira policy, in the name of politics. But it is far from it. 

He is crying more for Bandits.

3. Quietly refresh the memory of *PAPA, MAMA, PICKIN LOGO* to look out for   LP logo

4. Your team should encourage people not to sell their votes as opposition will be there. If possible collect their money and vote LP.

5. Ensure you go early, early so you vote on time and you can be able to help others LP  in your polling unit.
 *Every single vote is important.*

6. See to it that you and your team deliver your polling unit, take it upon you like your project for better naija even in opposition dominated areas.

7. Ensure OBIDIENT use their index finger to vote and they should use the other stain free hand to put the ballot paper in the ballot box to avoid a wasted vote.

9. *Watch out for the finger of the INEC official/agents when the votes are being counted.*

2/21/23, 1:31 PM - +234 703 714 8734: I was shocked too, no wonder his bragging rights. Those okada men from Kano are in every nuck and corner of this country, getting agents wasn't a problem. Maybe their spread down south was a political strategy.
2/21/23, 1:53 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But there is a big problem for LP
2/21/23, 1:53 PM - +234 803 097 7516: The major and highly populated stated don't have agents
2/21/23, 1:54 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Kano, Oyo, Lagos, Kaduna, Katsina and Rivers
2/21/23, 1:54 PM - +234 803 097 7516: LP has the least agents there
2/21/23, 1:55 PM - +234 803 097 7516: How do you have 4 agents in Katsina 🤔

2/21/23, 4:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Don't keep your hopes too high, even if kwankwaso collapses his structure for Atiku he is  unlikely to win.
2/21/23, 4:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: A man who raises his arms to sing the national anthem leaves much to be desired. Nigerians will use him to cash out, then do the needful
2/21/23, 4:51 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I think you over estimate the capabilities of Nigerians speaking in a general sense
2/21/23, 4:51 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The percentage of Nigerians able to make integrated decision making is really not as high as you might think
2/21/23, 4:51 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Even if Atiku wins all the 13 states in the NW and NE, it won't be enough to become president
2/21/23, 4:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: These same Nigerians in the NW and NE gave Buhari over 10 million votes over 3 election cycles and he lost
2/21/23, 4:53 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While I will vote for Peter Obi, I hope that the many Nigerians who do not understand the nitty gritty of the points we all make or learn from their past mistakes will simply ride the tide of OBidience and vote for him
2/21/23, 4:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Yea the elections are likely to see a run off. It would become clearer when it’s a head to head between two candidates
2/21/23, 4:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Let's go down the history lane.

No Nigerian dead or alive has become president without winning at least 3 zones.
  

Shagari, Obasanjo, Yaradua, Jonathan and Buhari won by at least bloc votes from 3( NOT tWO) geopolitical zones.

Now Atiku would have stood a chance if he had block votes from the NC or SS or SE or SW, unfortunately it is no so.
2/21/23, 4:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: As much as a run off is likely, it is also likely we have a winner from the first ballot
2/21/23, 4:58 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I’d be delighted if we do
2/21/23, 4:59 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While history sure has its value, the times we live in and the nature of the frontline candidates where we literally have one from each major region with an interesting mix of religion could skew this particular election
2/21/23, 5:17 PM - +234 703 505 6225: You know the way @ Ayomoh. Polling agent in a place where you are not strong may just be an exercise in futility. 
Stronger parties will just buy over your agents😃😃

2/22/23, 12:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While this is sad, they should move past this. Problem defined!!! With few days to go, what’s the solution? Since the PVCs Al come from a particular region, can some good people generate a list and share widely
2/22/23, 12:44 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: With definite collection points defined!! Let the internet do its work
2/22/23, 12:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you are able to in the next 2 days get even 20% of these to the rightful owners, that is some progress
2/22/23, 12:45 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Doing multiple videos with the PVCs will not help right now

There are plans to use SM and the internet to complement this.

2/22/23, 1:06 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Apt!
2/22/23, 1:06 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Next point is to confirm that these were not locations captured as polling units without voters and cancelled by INEC
2/22/23, 1:07 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This message was deleted
2/22/23, 1:08 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It was one of those cancelled because people didn't come to collect their PVCs 

The way out is dicey.

A court order, might suffice so as not to disenfranchise them
2/22/23, 1:09 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It still needs to be investigated to get to the root of it
2/22/23, 1:10 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: How did this large cache of PVCs end up in a “forest”
2/22/23, 1:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Brother, INEC has a long way to go 

Take the biometrics and print these cards immediately and bury the issue of Nigerians not getting their cards
2/22/23, 1:15 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Link it to their BVN and NIN and have a foolproof database

2/23/23, 7:26 PM - +234 806 529 3872: A MESSAGE TO CHRISTIANS FROM AN OBIDIENT MUSLIM.

,,,,May ALLAH forbid. Tinubu winning this election. It will mean that  Christians won't be taking serious again in this country.

Three major candidates in this election are Muslims and one serious, brilliant, capable, diginified candidate is a Christian. Meanwhile 44% of the Nigerian population are Christians. I Have no idea how many Christians have voters card but am sure 25% of we Muslims will vote for ObiDatti so I keep wondering how will Obi loose?

One thing I am sure of is that no Muslim will vote for a Christian - Christian ticket because we value our faith, we respect our prophet and will not sell our religion for anything.

Some one told me that 40 to 50% Christians will vote for Tinubu/ Shettima ticket. So am wondering if Christians really take Jesus serious like how we Muslims take  Mohammed?
If Tinubu/ Shettima ticket gets even 15% in the south east and south south then I will be for long time wondering what Christianity stands for. 

As a Muslim, my believe is that Atiku, Tinubu and Kwankaso will share the Muslim votes. Therefore, if 90% of the Christians vote for ObiDatti with 25% votes from the educated  unbiased, justified and civilized Muslims, how then will Obi not win? 

All what Obi needs is just to clear the South East and South, South with a big margin, get 30% in the South West, 30% in the Middle Belt, 25% north east and 15% north west or even 10%, he will win. 

I am addressing you Christians. If you want to be relevant in Nigeria say No to a Muslim/ Muslim Ticket. If not, your Children and childrens Children will suffer for your mistake ( maybe because of selfish interest) in this 2023 election. (A word is enough for the wise.) I rest my case. 
Thanks -> Umar.

*2023 presidency: Obi, Atiku, Tinubu; the good, the bad, the ugly!:*
By Olu Fasan
February 23, 2023

AS I write this, the much-anticipated presidential election is four days away, on Saturday, February 25. The air is thick with anxiety about the outcome. Would Nigerians make the right choice? Well, allow me to give my final thoughts on the three leading candidates: Peter Obi (Labour Party), Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Bola Tinubu (APC). Victory for any of them would mark a seismic shift in Nigeria’s political history. So, which candidate poses the least or the greatest danger?

To answer that question, let’s use the popular metaphor: the good, the bad and the ugly. In this context, Obi is “the good”, Atiku is “the bad”, Tinubu is “the ugly”! Of course, that’s not to say Obi is a saint or Tinubu is the devil incarnate. But for Nigeria’s presidency, Obi would be the best choice; Tinubu would, unquestionably, be the worst!

Let’s start with “the ugly”, shall we? Well, a Tinubu presidency would set extremely damaging precedents. If elected, Tinubu would be the first multibillionaire president whose source of wealth lacks known legitimacy; the first president officially linked with drug-trafficking, with a record of criminal forfeiture; the first president whose entire pedigree is shrouded in utter mystery.  

“Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people,” the Bible says in Proverbs 14.34. And says in Isaiah 5:20: “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil.” The Quran has similar injunctions. So, those, like President Buhari, who want Tinubu to be Nigeria’s next president, knowing his acute integrity and character defects, are enemies of Nigeria. No nation succeeds without core moral/ethical standards. Yet, a Tinubu presidency would turn Nigeria into an abyss of moral depravity, where a fish rots from the head.

There’s also, of course, the devilry of the Muslim-Muslim ticket. If Tinubu won, Nigeria would, for the first time in a democracy, have both Muslim president and vice-president. Those citing MKO Abiola/Babagana Kingibe’s Muslim-Muslim ticket of 1993 should remember that the Babangida regime aborted the putative presidency. Was the same-faith ticket a factor? We may never know!

But, be in no doubt, if Tinubu’s Muslim-Muslim ticket prevailed, it would be a tinderbox for aggravated religious tension and crisis in Nigeria. Furthermore, a President Tinubu, if he did eight years and was succeeded by a Northern Muslim for eight years, would entrench a Muslim presidency in Nigeria for 24 consecutive years, from 2015 to 2039. That would escalate fears of Islamisation. A Tinubu presidency could also deny Igbos a credible route to the presidency for 16 years, totalling 40 since 1999, deepening disunity and instability in Nigeria.  Thus, a Tinubu presidency would pose an existential danger to Nigeria. Yet, the imminent danger is that Nigeria is not safe in the hands of Tinubu and his acolytes, given their desperation for power and impetuous handling of crisis. When things don’t go Tinubu’s way, he blurts out unpresidential outbursts. And he’s surrounded by people who dissemble and make incendiary comments.

Take Nasir el-Rufai, the Kaduna State governor and Tinubu’s Man Friday. In 2019, he issued a shocking threat to foreign election observers, telling them if they interfered in the presidential election “you’ll go back in body bags”. Now, in 2023, with another presidential poll, he’s reverting to type.

In a recent state broadcast, which countered President Buhari’s national broadcast, el-Rufai said the presidency introduced the currency redesign policy to provoke a crisis so that the presidential election didn’t hold, “leading to an Interim National Government to be led by a retired Army General”. Another objective, he said, was to trigger a breakdown of law and order that “would provide a fertile foundation for a military take-over”. Essentially, el-Rufai, who echoed Tinubu, was saying that President Buhari planned to truncate his own government, with less than three months left in office, by asking a retired General to lead an Interim National Government or by actually provoking a coup. Utterly irresponsible!

But here’s the problem. Given that a Tinubu presidency would be deeply unpopular and crisis-ridden, and given that Tinubu and his “unbreakable team” lack the ability to handle crisis without fuelling it, one must worry that the military intervention that el-Rufai talked recklessly about might become a self-fulfilling prophesy under a Tinubu presidency. 

It’s really hard to imagine a Federal Government led by Tinubu, so deeply flawed morally and ethically, with a cabal consisting of el-Rufai, Festus Keyamo, Femi Fani-Kayode, Bayo Onanuga and Dele Alake serving Nigeria’s best interests. No, it won’t. That’s why Tinubu is “the ugly”, and why he mustn’t be Nigeria’s next president! He’s Nigeria’s worst nightmare. 

But what about Atiku? Well, Atiku is far better and more presidential than Tinubu. Yet, he’s “the bad”. Why? First, he has failed to shake off the perception of corruption. Unlike Tinubu, the “owner” of Lagos, accused of state capture, Atiku has never directly controlled the public purse. Yet, his lax attitude to conflict of interest and cronyism falls below international standards for public office.  For instance, asked in 2019 whether he would sell state assets to his friends, he said: “Why not, I will enrich my friends.” He’s a brash capitalist and laissez-faire free marketeer, but that fuels concerns about his wide-ranging privatisation agenda.

Secondly, if Atiku became president, he would be the first Northerner, under a democracy, to succeed another Northerner. Atiku would have his work cut out in promoting national unity because another Northerner succeeding President Buhari would provoke deep ethnic tension just as a Muslim-Muslim presidency would ignite festering religious conflict.   

Finally, then, Obi “the good”. If elected, he would tick many right boxes: the first elected president of Igbo extraction; a Southern-Christian president succeeding a Northern-Muslim president, with a balanced ticket. What’s more, an Obi presidency would be a breath of fresh air; relatively young president and vice-president, both largely untainted. Above all, Obi has the best manifesto, focusing on far-reaching economic, political and institutional reforms to dismantle the elite capture and extractive state that inhibit Nigeria’s progress. 

Truth is, whoever wins the presidential poll, Nigeria will never be the same again, for good or for bad. Hence Nigerians must make the right choice this week!

And then see the websites trying to debunk the rumor. Wisdomblog and radionigeriaabuja

SDP doesn't have a strong voice. I'm afraid they might never make it big

Romey Homey, reason am oh. After this election there'll be APC, PDP and LP. 

Maybe some NNPP

SDP might never rise and even if they rise you fit done reach like 80 by then

Now that White Lion has suppressed opposition and LP isn't strong in Kogi

Consider porting to LP with your influence and Kogi politics and you might have decent prospects

This SDP fit no work oh

Loyalty fit no pay
2/24/23, 5:05 AM - +234 803 310 4903: 🤣😂
2/24/23, 5:06 AM - +234 803 310 4903: Chino help me beg the boy, I have done all I can to make him Obidient.
2/24/23, 5:38 AM - +234 817 950 7218: And not even for Obi's sake oh

For his own personal ambition

Smell the coffee and switch sides

So that in 8years time when labour is doing well you can claim to be one of the initial key men in Kogi state and get something
2/24/23, 5:52 AM - +234 803 310 4903: 🤔
2/24/23, 5:52 AM - +234 803 310 4903: You are onto something here Chino
2/24/23, 6:06 AM - +44 7466 095552: Does it matter though? SDP will get all of 2300 votes in the 36 states, then prince Adeyemi will be able to put it on his CV that he was a former presidential election contestant in his country
2/24/23, 6:07 AM - +44 7466 095552: Sowore will get more votes than that oga but Romey say all and sundry go vote am 😅😅

2/24/23, 6:08 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly. It doesn't matter for SDP and for LP

But it matters for our guy Romey

His political future is at stake
2/24/23, 6:10 AM - +44 7466 095552: You have to give it to romey, the man has his convictions amd sticks to them 🙌🏾
2/24/23, 6:10 AM - +44 7466 095552: And I’d rather have someone voting/politicking based on principle rather than personal gain

2/24/23, 6:12 AM - +234 803 458 5862: Nobody can win 3 zones en bloc in this election. Obi will win SE, SS enbloc, and NC by a small margin, then pilfer from SW and NE.
2/24/23, 6:12 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That could be enough
2/24/23, 6:14 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Omo

If he doesn't want to go for personal gain let me remember his guys na

If he makes it we sef go benefit

He should do it for his men
2/24/23, 6:14 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Maybe enbloc was not the right word, but Majority votes

For every Zone, there will be a winner. Whoever wins the popular votes in the North central and wins any other two regions is our next president.

The question is between Obi, Atiku and Tinubu, who is likely to win the majority votes in the North central
2/24/23, 6:15 AM - +234 803 458 5862: *Obi*
2/24/23, 6:15 AM - +44 7466 095552: 😂😂😂

2/24/23, 12:49 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Brother why do you always doubt the authenticity first before believing it. I know you have a subtle bias for Atiku. But the man is not clean either. Are you saying Atiku was not the brain behind the rigging machinery during prof Maurice Iwu in 2003?
2/24/23, 12:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's so clear and easy for me to believe than just disregard for won't of authenticity.

2/24/23, 12:54 PM - +234 806 092 4290: 😃I have no subtle bias towards Atiku. I have never been one of supporters but I don't have to believe something before verifying. This is a virtual conversation between 3 persons and that is supposed to be secret. So which of them recorded and released it?
2/24/23, 12:54 PM - +234 806 529 3872: Anything is possible in Nigeria especially with Atiku gate antecedent
2/24/23, 12:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I know these things don't just happen ordinarily. There is a divine intrusion
2/24/23, 12:55 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Brother nothing is a secret in this world once you have 3 pple involved.

2/24/23, 12:55 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I believe the SPV recordings were true because the person who directly was involved in the conversations released them, even though the culprit can still deny it.

2/24/23, 1:02 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Guy, we are talking about cloning of voices. I am not saying those in the records are some other persons making the conversations. I only doubt the conversations ever held
2/24/23, 1:03 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Now you come. It merits forensic investigations, so until it is verified either of us could be wrong
2/24/23, 1:05 PM - +234 806 529 3872: Yea. In the meantime better to err on side of caution. Take the rumour seriously.
2/24/23, 1:13 PM - +234 803 658 2567: If this is credible, then a one Nigeria is still possible. .

2/24/23, 1:16 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Have you used the soft ware that does this to arrive at this conclusion?
2/24/23, 1:17 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I haven’t used it but I know it exists. Because of a similar situation that occurred in the past. I have certainly never had need to use such

I would expect the authorities to do the needful. But within the scope of information available to me, esp as far as tech is concerned, I know for a fact that this is doctored.
2/24/23, 1:19 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Don't you think it is better to toll the path of caution than believing what could be false and spreading it?
2/24/23, 1:22 PM - +234 803 658 2567: Pay attention to point 5. 

We do this for not just today or tomorrow, but the future of Nigeria. 

For the children we have today and those unborn, what kind of life do you hope to give them?

We all know what's going on in Nigeria and the onus is on each and everyone of us to do the right thing.

Forget about religion, forget about tribe, forget about what gets into your pockets today (think about how sustained your pockets should be) and vote right.

Let the best candidate win.

I am #ObiDatti. What are you ?

2/24/23, 1:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Okay, but this one is grave enough to allow room for it, than be dismissive.

I feel even if it is fake, the first thing to do is not dismiss it because it MIGHT be fake.

If Atiku were a clean man, it will be proper for me to dismiss it. But is he?


If someone tells you a thief is about to rob a bank, will you doubt the authenticity of a recording to that effect?.

I get your points on the possibility AI, which I highlighted earlier, but for me, it's easier for me to bliv it is true that it been doctored

2/24/23, 1:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You can't even do that with just a voice note, you would have accumulated many voices notes to get an algorithm
2/24/23, 1:25 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: All your points are solid bro. Which is why I tried to say our assessments are a function of how much we know exists in the tech space. It’s like telling someone who was born 1945 that you can video call someone in the US and they don’t believe
2/24/23, 1:26 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Lol don’t be left behind by tech bro! With all due respect I get your points and I only said at a first glance or listening I can say it’s not authentic. Doesn’t mean I won’t be interested in exploring further to prove it.

2/24/23, 1:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I hope you know AI doesn't even sound like the real voice
2/24/23, 1:29 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Which is where Chris reference to voice signatures come in
2/24/23, 1:29 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Abiola, "be calming down". Do we really need these voice notes to know there's going to be bribing or buying of votes? What can you do if the voice note is actually true? Will the law enforcement agent arrest any of them based on this recordings? They can only arrest those they catch executing the plan. Those that are not caught will still execute the plan successfully.
2/24/23, 1:29 PM - +234 810 006 7926: So let's start with the Atiku video I uploaded. You have one week to make it look he was advocating for better elections
2/24/23, 1:29 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You just need to get it as close to the real voice as possible to create the impression you already have

2/24/23, 1:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Your voice note wil be better
2/24/23, 1:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Let's  use the one with 3 people. The more the merrier
2/24/23, 1:32 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I am honestly falling off my sit here  Abiola. My guy!!! The voice note has a lot of doubt. I really do not have much to gain proving this to you. We are both in the same camp. In the next 48 hours all of these would be irrelevant and we would be discussing Victor Osimhen

2/24/23, 1:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: As to what can we do if the voice notes is true, let's wait until after elections, I'm probably the 3rd after it has been forwarded to many Nigerians in their millions. 

This is damaging to his already fragile morality ratings especially in zones where he desperately needs 25%
2/24/23, 1:38 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Back to square one. you can't be dismissive with a wave of the hand and conclude it is not authentic.
until you have subjected it to a forensic audit, then I can take you serious
2/24/23, 1:39 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Bros, anyone that has made up his mind to vote for Atiku will not be changing that because of any video. Even if Atiku or Tinibu is arrested today, those that believe in them or forced to believe in them will still go and vote them.
2/24/23, 1:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Campaign is over. It is time to strengthen all avaliable structures, especially in the area of logistics to make sure people come out to vote and all votes count
2/24/23, 1:42 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Not talking of those whose minds are made up Omale. To the undecided voters out there who are a significant no, even if it is real or fake it is damaging to him.
Rest my case
2/24/23, 1:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You must mobilize 1000 people to the cause
2/24/23, 1:54 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The subtle bias 😃

2/24/23, 4:01 PM - +234 806 675 1526: You drew my attention to nairaland that is not one of the national dailies and find fault when I brought your notice to a nationally recognized media. 

Nawa o.
2/24/23, 4:07 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Nairaland quoted from a known daily

But that's why I sought your opinion because I felt it'd be more valid
2/24/23, 4:32 PM - +234 803 658 2567: Very important message here. 


Especially how to fold afterwards.
2/24/23, 4:36 PM - +234 803 658 2567: A wise strategy would be to align with LP at this time.


Well, who am I to make such when I'm not "Sabinus" the wise man.

They have responded. It was done to stop terrorist
2/24/23, 7:04 PM - +234 806 675 1526: Unfortunately for them, Natasha will win the elections there. That’s too extreme.
2/24/23, 7:05 PM - +234 817 950 7218: That'll be interesting to see


Is Dino contesting for anything?
2/24/23, 7:06 PM - +234 706 647 6470: To check your Polling Unit again as INEC did some changes on Polling Unit.

2/24/23, 11:17 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Thank you for this clarification 

It's karma for Atiku. 
PDP put a video out with Obi endorsing Atiku in 2023( the took clips from 2019 when he was vp), to confuse undecided voters. In Bauchi, posters flooded the streets with Obi as his vice, in 2023
2/24/23, 11:20 PM - +234 810 006 7926: BAT cannot win. He will likely come distant third behind Atiku.
 Be rest assured Obi is winning. 

Just play your part brother and it's a home run.

2/25/23, 9:32 AM - +234 806 675 1526: Please check around. It shouldn’t be too far from you again. It could also be at that same polling station just that the voting points must have been changed because to redistribute the load on the other checking points. 

Check the registers posted on the wall at all polling units you arrive close to you. 

Your name has to be on the register before you are allowed to vote. 

Registers are always posted on the walls or board for voters to confirm before voting. 

So when you arrive at polling units close to you, please go straight to the board where the names are posted and check for yours then proceed to voting.

INEC has refused to upload it. They want to go and manipulate in collation center

So someone will have pictures of results from his PU and see different one on INEC server and not run mad?

Prominent people already crying foul online and BAT's guys are still adamantly sticking to the rigging plan.

Layers of rigging, from delay, to no ballots, to vote buying, inec buying, violence

And it still wasn't enough.

Where Nation News get this one?

Na dem dey do the collation? 

No responsible media outlet has announced any sort of outcome

They are all talking about the voting process only
2/26/23, 8:44 AM - +234 817 950 7218: These old guys really don't understand the new era

Nobody cares about nation newspaper headlines
2/26/23, 8:44 AM - +234 817 950 7218: It's in the old days that you'll be using newspaper to control the narrative ahead of your successful rigging
2/26/23, 8:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Have you heard of fake it till it happens
2/26/23, 8:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Until Nigeria learn how to implement elections we can't be there
2/26/23, 8:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Many lessons to learn from the last Kenya election few months ago
2/26/23, 8:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I can see the gaps and difference
2/26/23, 8:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: INEC structure encourages rigging
2/26/23, 8:49 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Gbam!

Because if he wins the electoral process itself will become a lot better
2/26/23, 9:20 AM - +234 817 950 7218: What will you say is the difference?


For me it's the refusal to upload the results onto the server

Once that is implemented I don't see how bad it is

If the results are uploaded from the PU, everything is fine
2/26/23, 9:21 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Exactly

It's going to be a struggle for Obi if he doesn't get atleast 25% in all the SW states.

2/26/23, 9:53 AM - +234 703 505 6225: This is the result from the 12 LGAs in Ekiti and I heard it is the same pattern in the other SW states

2/26/23, 9:55 AM - +234 810 006 7926: At least he is second and eclipse Atikus chances. If Atiku cannot get 25% in the South West, South East, South South and North Central, he cannot be president, more so as he is having his votes reduced from strong opposition of Kwankwaso, Tinubu and Obi
2/26/23, 9:56 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I can't pray I am sorry. We have prayed for so long. At this point we would rather pray that people needed to die to liberate Nigeria should. Where are the mfm people 🤣🤣🤣
2/26/23, 9:57 AM - +234 803 097 7516: My brother
2/26/23, 9:57 AM - +234 810 006 7926: And you can't use Ekiti to arrive at a general statement.

Let's see how it goes, it's actually better than you think
2/26/23, 9:57 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The truth
2/26/23, 9:57 AM - +234 703 505 6225: You have a point there but I think Tinubu is the main contender here and he seems to be doing well in the NorthEast states
2/26/23, 9:58 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Of Borno and Yobe which we predicted
2/26/23, 10:00 AM - +234 817 950 7218: <Media omitted>
2/26/23, 10:00 AM - +234 803 458 5862: Dang, are you listening to Premium times, when I saw their arrant bias, I stopped reading their news. The guy is tinubu's boy na
2/26/23, 10:01 AM - +234 810 006 7926: So applies to Tinubu.

He cannot get 25% in South south, South East, North central and he cannot get 25% in North West. He will give Atiku a fight in North East.

Don't forget I told you much earlier NE is to be split into 3 of 2 states each.

APC will win Borno and yobe

PDP will win Bauchi plus or minus Adamawa

Obi will win Taraba and do well in Gombe, Adamawa
2/26/23, 10:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Innalilah

Pray oh

Na only God fit save this country 🤣
2/26/23, 10:02 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Bode are you still having hopes Tinubu will win?

Don't invest your emotions into Tinubu, his return on investment is poor
2/26/23, 10:03 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Leave tribe aside, Obi is the best Candidate out there and our next president
2/26/23, 10:14 AM - +234 806 529 3872: <Media omitted>
2/26/23, 10:19 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I don't have hope Tinubu will win. I believe the election would be inconclusive after massive rigging and irregularities
2/26/23, 10:42 AM - +234 703 505 6225: Hmmmm. Forget the few polling unit results you saw online, I really dont see Obi getting 25% in any of those 2 states.
Sorry for sounding pessimistic. 
My pathway to Obi winning requires him to get atleast 25% in all the 17 southern states.
2/26/23, 10:44 AM - +234 703 505 6225: @ I know if Bode is "hoping" Tinubu wins, it's just the maths.
This election is not that very difficult to predict
2/26/23, 10:47 AM - +234 703 505 6225: I am very obedient also and would not like Tinubu near that office. But if SouthWest goes the way it looks then Obi's best chance to Presidency will be if he wins the Majority votes forcing a run-off
2/26/23, 10:49 AM - +234 817 950 7218: There's a pathway without Ekiti though. Since Kogi and Kaduna seem to be entering the 25% states
2/26/23, 10:50 AM - +234 817 950 7218: If Taraba goes in as well and Niger then he can even afford to lose an extra SW state
2/26/23, 10:55 AM - +234 703 505 6225: Very possible. 
I actually counted Kaduna as part of states Obi will get 25%
2/26/23, 10:55 AM - +234 703 505 6225: If he gets 25% in Kogi and the other Southwest states, then we are still in contention
2/26/23, 10:56 AM - +234 703 505 6225: 🙏
2/26/23, 10:57 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Meanwhile random shout out to @2348036928469 

He is working closely with an APC man and has been very rational in his support for his principal

He has come out to defend his principal's achievements while cautiously staying away from controversy

He is not expected to criticize the party and he didn't but he also at no point either here on anywhere else showed an irrational support for people that were indefensible


Considering how others have acted in similar situations, I think I'd give kudos to him for doing it the right way
2/26/23, 10:58 AM - +234 703 505 6225: I totally agree with you. Absolute class from @2348036928469 👍

2/26/23, 11:03 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Again should I not get to have it, not much will change
2/26/23, 11:03 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I have many other people that just enter party small and see small money and sudden go crazy because of that

It's very unpleasant to the eyes
2/26/23, 11:04 AM - +234 703 505 6225: @2348100067926 .I  think he will get atleast 25% in almost all the 19 Northern states. You add 6 Southwest states, then you have 25. 
Even if he gets 25% in 17 states in the North, assuming he doesn't get in Benue and plateau,  he will make up for it in states like Rivers and Ebonyi
2/26/23, 11:07 AM - +234 703 505 6225: I will add Kogi and Niger to your list.
I will be surprised if he gets 25% in these two states
2/26/23, 11:09 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Look at the map

Tinubu won't get 25% in
1.Abia
2. Anambra
3. Enugu
4. Ebonyi
5. Imo
6. Cross river
7. Akwa Ibom
8. Bayelsa
9. Edo
10. Delta
11. Rivers (???Wike currently)

So we need just 2-3 more right?

Do you really think he will get one quarter of the votes all place else?

Plateau?
Benue?
Then NW?(Sokoto and Zamfara?)
FCT will also be hard for him
2/26/23, 11:10 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Kogi is looking good oh

They were quiet but the results are looking good for LP

Not sure about Niger though

So in the end it's pretty tight

It's much harder for Atiku as the whole South seems out of it for him with the exception of maybe Delta
2/26/23, 11:12 AM - +234 703 505 6225: My pathway to Obi's victory was
17 Southern states plus.
Kaduna, plateau, Benue, Nassarawa, Adamawa, Taraba,?Gombe
2/26/23, 11:12 AM - +234 703 505 6225: If you remove Ekiti and add Kogi then you have a possibility
2/26/23, 11:13 AM - +234 703 505 6225: But I actually doubt Gombe
2/26/23, 11:13 AM - +234 703 505 6225: It is tight
2/26/23, 11:16 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Gombe and Adamawa I'm not sure of
2/26/23, 11:18 AM - +234 703 505 6225: Atiku  has a difficult pathway to getting 24 states indeed.
He will likely get at least 25% in like 17 Northern states, except Benue and Nassarawa, perhaps.
He may come second in all the South West states except Lagos.
Outside that, I don't know where else he can get 25%
2/26/23, 11:19 AM - +234 703 505 6225: He should get  25% in Adamawa. More sure of Adamawa than Gombe
2/26/23, 11:21 AM - +234 703 505 6225: As it is Tinubu has the surest pathway to 25% in atleast 25 states or more.
Na popular votes go fit stop am from winning sadly
2/26/23, 11:24 AM - +234 703 505 6225: At least 18 Northern states (except maybe Benue ).
Plus 6 South West states
And then any of ?? Rivers, Ebonyi, Cross River where he has governors supporting him
2/26/23, 11:25 AM - +234 703 505 6225: Unless a Miracle happens

INEC taking forever to announce what everyone already knows in this time and age  and  we keep quiet and say we are waiting ' verification'( or rather Manipulations).

For me the first step is to compare the results from your polling unit with that on the INEC server

The electoral system is quite a wonderful one which tries to ensure transparency. The task was to stay back and count and then later you can verify your polling unit online

Unfortunately the process for uploading the result was flawed and till now it's about 25% completed. But as long as it eventually gets complete, we should all first verify our own PUs

I hope we all have pictures of our polling unit results

You concerns should be whether or not he made such comment.

2/27/23, 11:59 AM - +234 817 950 7218: It's basically impossible for PO to win outright at this point. He has failed to get 25% in 2 SW states already (Osun and Ekiti)

So it's unlikely he can get 24 states

Basically impossible
2/27/23, 12:00 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Almost impossible*
2/27/23, 12:01 PM - +234 706 815 1299: Spread matters.
2/27/23, 12:01 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: You put a caveat. That has to mean there is a glimmer of hope?
2/27/23, 12:06 PM - +234 817 950 7218: It's not going to happen

SW didn't give him 25% in any state.

2/27/23, 12:34 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Okay. I guess we'll see how it goes
2/27/23, 12:37 PM - +234 810 006 7926: The courts may just be the one to decide who Nigeria's next president would be!. Any early celebrations may be( just maybe premature).

I know understand why Lagos and Ondo states did not have LP logos for the Senatorial and house of reps ballot boxes.

And why Ekiti's results may have been uploaded 5 days before the elections.
2/27/23, 12:38 PM - +234 817 950 7218: That 5days before is probably not true

That one na propaganda
2/27/23, 12:41 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Even your propangandanist theory as espoused, I don't bliv it.

Let's see how it goes.

One thing is certain, the journey has begun and it starts with the state that had the blood of those who were shot singing the National anthem speak!
2/27/23, 12:45 PM - +234 817 950 7218: It's hard to imagine Atiku rigging in Tinubu's SW. The only rational thing is if they decided to share the votes for LP

Which is possible
2/27/23, 12:46 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You were no dey SW dey propound theory. 

Dey play
2/27/23, 12:47 PM - +234 810 006 7926: God bless you Plateau ❤️
2/27/23, 12:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I'm just saying. Tinubu has strong influence, it's his region. It's hard to imagine Atiku outrigging Tinubu in units that have his agents
2/27/23, 12:48 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I dunno sha

THIS IS A GREAT WIN FOR US ALREADY!!!

I pray it climaxes to the grand win for us ... But it is clear that the masses cannot no longer be taken for granted.....

2/27/23, 1:05 PM - +234 806 566 2895: It's because APC was desperate for 25%
2/27/23, 1:06 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Even PDP is scrambling for 25% in South
2/27/23, 1:06 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Told you.
2/27/23, 1:07 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Who knows if they decided to share LP votes

Tinubu say give me LP votes in the North and I'll give you the ones in SW

Lol
2/27/23, 1:07 PM - +234 817 950 7218: I'm sorry

Sometimes I have to see to believe

He has a point though. The tension is high and things may escalate the way things are going 🤦🏿‍♂️
2/27/23, 6:51 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The voice of the masses

      While we await the collation of the results of the last Presidential elections, I would like to sample opinions from the general house and specialists in these areas on 2 questions with Question 2 as a follow up to Question 1. 

1. What is the greatest challenge for Hypertensive and Diabetic patients in Nigeria who have accessed treatment affecting their treatment outcome. 
2. With resources at your disposal or a Grant, what solution would you be proferring? Please share your thoughts no matter how unrealistic.

2/28/23, 3:40 PM - +234 806 529 3872: ICT age is the worst time for election rigging as every observer is a freelance journalist with smart phones gathering evidences.

2/28/23, 5:14 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Technically this may mean, All the rigging amounted to nothing at the end
2/28/23, 5:17 PM - +234 806 158 7077: Can you share the section of the electoral law concerning the declaration of the president?
2/28/23, 5:17 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I heard Keyamo interpreting the clause that the law did not say FCT must be part of the 25%, that it is part of the cumulative 2/3 of all the states + FCT. This means that accumulating 25% win in about 24 to 25 states, including or excluding FCT, the person wins, if he has the majority vote
2/28/23, 5:21 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Yes. It's actually in the constitution of Nigeria
2/28/23, 5:22 PM - +234 806 158 7077: Pls, share.
2/28/23, 5:23 PM - +234 803 458 5862: He is right for the first time sir
2/28/23, 5:24 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Misleading
2/28/23, 5:25 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Will do in a jiffy
2/28/23, 5:26 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Unfortunately we are going to have him and FFK for at least another 4 years, except justice prevails at the end of the day
2/28/23, 5:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: <Media omitted>
2/28/23, 5:29 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You have to first:

Win by majority votes

Then you have to win by at least 25% of the 36 states( 24 states) and the FCT( making a total of 25 states).

If you win by 25% of 24  states and you don't win the FCT by 25%, you can't be declared president


The problem here is the conjunction 'AND'.

Unfortunately Lawyers who are sympathetic to APC will say 25% is not required, but for selfish gains.

The constitution is clear and this has been made clear before the elections by INEC lawyers
2/28/23, 5:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I am afraid Keyamo is right
2/28/23, 5:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: <Media omitted>
2/28/23, 5:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Often times when the states of Nigeria are mentioned it is 36 states and the FCT
2/28/23, 5:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The FCT isn’t a separate entity as it is one and the same part of Nigeria
2/28/23, 5:31 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Exactly. This also applies to this case
2/28/23, 5:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: So when 2/3 of this same entity is described it doesn’t single out the FCT. I know we want to grasp for straws but this particular straw is too slippery.
2/28/23, 5:31 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Also, there's no way someone will be mandated to win FCT compulsorily
2/28/23, 5:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You follow keyamo at your peril. He is not likely to give you an objective view.


The FCT is a territory and not a state.

The constitution as applicable to states for implementation also applies to the TERRITORY FCT
2/28/23, 5:34 PM - +234 810 006 7926: However the constitution is clear as regards the requirements you must meet to be president.


I'm happy this is happening, because it will test our judiciary.

We might need the judges to interpret this.
2/28/23, 5:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: @2348100067926 this alone should make you agree with me. What special status requires that fct be singled out for any candidate to “must” win 25%
2/28/23, 5:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Why not Benue? Why not Lagos?
2/28/23, 5:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: That is why you must have a geographical spread. You can win only 10 states, but might not become president
2/28/23, 5:35 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It is as it is.
2/28/23, 5:36 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Abiola, you need to come down to the reality before us and also be objective. There's nowhere you see 37 states, it is always 36 states and FCT (making it 37) so anywhere states are referred to, and FCT is not excluded then it will always be referred to ---states and FCT.
2/28/23, 5:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: You already answered your question by saying Geographical spread- 24 of any of the 36 states + FCT simply becos FCT results are also declared in isolation of the 36 states
2/28/23, 5:38 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Don't worry Victor is not for us to agree. 

Let the judges decide.

But it is clear.

I think  the interpretation of the word And AND is the problem here


If I say a candidate must score 5 As in WAEC AND NECO before he enters a prestigious University, how do you understand this to mean @14159348891
2/28/23, 5:38 PM - +234 806 092 4290: The court case that will be put forward are the blatant evidence based riggings all over, which I doubt our corrupt judiciary will overturn. Tinibu, sadly, is now Nigeria's next president
2/28/23, 5:38 PM - +234 810 006 7926: @14159348891
2/28/23, 5:40 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: It simply means 5As in WAEC and NECO combined just to patronize you. However if you wanted that requirement to apply to the two examinations in isolation you would say 5As in WAEC and 5As in NECO respectively
2/28/23, 5:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: You have brought a good example by yourself that should settle the argument. That means, you require 5As in either WAEC alone, NECO alone or from both combined. All you need is that 5As.
2/28/23, 5:41 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I don’t think Tinubu will win a court case. There is evidence beyond reasonable doubt
2/28/23, 5:41 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: On many levels
2/28/23, 5:42 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The electoral act was not followed to the later already grounds for invalidating the results ….. Ref to Okoro vs okoro 1989
2/28/23, 5:42 PM - +234 806 092 4290: In Nigeria? This is not Tinibu, it is INEC that will be sued
2/28/23, 5:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Thinking can't help us here. Let the judges do their job.

A rerun might be in the offing.

With the blatant rigging even clear to the blind, it will be difficult to a compromised judge to look away
2/28/23, 5:43 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Refer to judiciary cases for the last 8 years not 1989.
2/28/23, 5:43 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Not it!
2/28/23, 5:46 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Same way you so trusted INEC and people to vote with conscience. I pray you are right this time, because this broad day robbery is unacceptable anywhere, except maybe Nigeria
2/28/23, 5:50 PM - +234 806 158 7077: Thank you for sharing
2/28/23, 5:51 PM - +234 810 006 7926: A rerun in 7 days is likely if Tinubu wins 24 states by at least 25% and does not win the FCT by 25%.

I'm liking this
2/28/23, 5:54 PM - +234 806 158 7077: I think "AND" was used to refer to FCT because it's not a state
2/28/23, 5:55 PM - +234 806 158 7077: However, a good Layer may win the case in favour of Abiola.
2/28/23, 5:55 PM - +234 803 458 5862: Yes
2/28/23, 5:55 PM - +234 803 458 5862: 🎯
2/28/23, 5:58 PM - +234 806 158 7077: It's assumed that FCT comprises people from the 36 states of Nigeria.
2/28/23, 6:04 PM - +234 806 529 3872: <Media omitted>
2/28/23, 6:07 PM - +234 806 529 3872: Makes sense for FCT to be a prerequisites as it is quite cosmopolitan and a micro Nigeria.
A candidate that is fairly popular should be able to get 25% in FCT if he can't get a straight win.
2/28/23, 6:19 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Buhari didn’t win FCT in 2019 @2348100067926 and he was declared winner
2/28/23, 6:20 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Interesting times.
2/28/23, 6:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Most Nigerians are not worried about the process but the product
2/28/23, 6:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: My assumption is that if obi was rigged for like Yaradua, Nigerians won't mind
2/28/23, 6:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Your making reference to a rigged election 

What was his percentage score? Did he win 25% votes cast?
2/28/23, 6:27 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Like Obi will always say. It is better to loose doing the right thing than win doing the wrong thing.

To assume if it was Obi that was rigged doesn't make or justify Tinubu's rigging
2/28/23, 6:29 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Rigged or not if he didn’t meet the requirements he wouldn’t have been declared right ?
2/28/23, 6:30 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And my point is really not to the rigging. Rather it is to the conditionality we have been debating about the need to win FCT to be declared
2/28/23, 6:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: What was Buhari's percentage for FCT in 2019
2/28/23, 6:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I am simply seeing a lot of what Bishop Feyi said happening right now
2/28/23, 6:31 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Tinubu will be declared winner soon
2/28/23, 6:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Not all prophecies come to pass. Prophecies are foretold and sometimes amendments made to prevent it.

2/28/23, 6:35 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I just double checked again. He actually scored above 25%
2/28/23, 6:36 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Initial statement withdrawn with apology after verification
2/28/23, 6:41 PM - +234 806 092 4290: They are actually debating this FCT inclusiveness or exclusiveness in Arise TV
2/28/23, 6:43 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Actually Tinubu rigged just that he outrigged Atiku

INEC should save herself of the disgrace. Yes mistakes have been made, but what she does NOW either to consolidate or Right the wrong by ordering a fresh elections will make or mar us
2/28/23, 7:24 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Mahmood said , no amount of pressure would make him do so.

Go to court
2/28/23, 7:26 PM - +234 806 092 4290: Just my thoughts on this 2/3 of the states and FCT. 2/3 of 37 is 24.6 which is approx. 25. Why do I keep hearing 24?
2/28/23, 7:31 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He doesn't have a choice. 

It is a bitter point he may eventually come to.

The pressures are on him to do the right thing 

And it will be foolhardy to stand by something that does not stand.

No body insists on something that is glaring to everyone EXCEPT He himself is complicit and then the courts will determine who is Nigeria's next president and not INEC.
2/28/23, 7:32 PM - +234 706 647 6470: We have passed this  stage sha
2/28/23, 7:32 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It doesn't work that way FCT is a separate Entity that is cosmopolitan and has Nigerians from every state and tribe. So you have to get 25% in the FCT
2/28/23, 7:46 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I just hope that is the case. I am now tending to agree with you because 2/3 of 36 is 24 states, so if FCT is inclusive in the equation then it should be at least 25 states, not the 24 I keep hearing. But from the collation so far, will Peter be second?
2/28/23, 7:50 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's complicated Brother. I think Rivers results has been suspended.

2/28/23, 10:47 PM - +234 706 815 1299: Not really. Most people seem to be surprised with the show put up by Obi in a few months sincerely. What is reawakening emotions is the fact that evidences for alterations of the results are glaring. Failure of uploading results from polling units is the main window that allowed alterations of results cause of the loss of confidence in the electoral process. Many people voted because of the confidence in INEC by the introduction of BVAS and the way it was tested in Osun state, such that an opposing party ousted a ruling sitting governor. Everyone thought that the legacy would be maintained. I remember even allaying fears of some voters during the elections and even explaining to them that any rigging that cannot be done at the polling unit level under the full watch of the party agents can never be done in this election based on the electoral Act. Alas, I was wrong because INEC dashed my expectations. If evidences for rigging were not glaringly handy, most people would get over their candidate's loss sooner than later.

By The President-Elect
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu,

28 February 2115
 
My fellow Nigerians, 

I am profoundly humbled that you have elected me to serve as the 16th president of our beloved republic. This is a shining moment in the life of any man and affirmation of our democratic existence. From my heart, I say thank you.

Whether you are Batified, Atikulated, Obidient, Kwankwasiyya, or have any other political affiliation, you voted for a better, more hopeful nation and I thank you for your participation and dedication to our democracy.

You decided to place your trust in the democratic vision of a Nigeria founded on shared prosperity and one nurtured by the ideals of unity, justice, peace and tolerance. Renewed hope has dawned in Nigeria.

We commend INEC for running a free and fair election. The lapses that did occur were relatively few in number and were immaterial to the final outcome.  With each cycle of elections, we steadily perfect this process so vital to our democratic life.

Today, Nigeria stands tall as the giant of Africa. It shines even brighter as the continent’s biggest democracy.

I thank all who supported my campaign. From President Buhari who adeptly led my campaign as its chairman, to my Vice Presidential Candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima. 

To the progressive governors of our party and this nation, to the party leadership, to our loyal party members. I owe you a debt of gratitude. To the entire campaign organization, I thank you sincerely. 

I thank my loving wife and dear family whose support was ceaseless and inspiring. Without you, this victory would not be possible.

I am grateful to Almighty God. By His mercy, I was born a son of Nigeria and through His sublime purpose I find myself the victor of this election. May He grant me the wisdom and courage to lead the nation to the greatness He alone has destined for it.

Finally, I thank the Nigerian people for their abiding belief in our democracy. I shall be a fair leader to all Nigerians. I will be in tune with your aspirations, charge up your energies and harness your talents to deliver a nation that we can be proud of.

To my fellow candidates, former VP Atiku, former governor Kwankwaso, former governor Obi and all others, I extend the hand of friendship. This was a competitive, high-spirited campaign.  

You have my utmost respect. 

Political competition must now give way to political conciliation and inclusive governance. 

During the election, you may have been my opponent but you were never my enemy.  In my heart, you are my brothers.

Still, I know some candidates will be hard put to accept the election results. It is your right to seek legal recourse. What is neither right nor defensible is for anybody to resort to violence. Any challenge to the electoral outcome should be made in a court of law, and not in the streets.

I also ask my supporters to let peace reign and tensions fade. We ran a principled, peaceful and progressive campaign. The aftermath of our campaign must be as benign.

Yes, there are divisions amongst us that should not exist. Many people are uncertain, angry and hurt; I reach out to every one of you. Let the better aspects of our humanity step forward at this fateful moment. Let us begin to heal and bring calm to our nation.

Now, to you, the young people of this country, I hear you loud and clear. I understand your pains, your yearnings for good governance, a functional economy and a safe nation that protects you and your future.

I am aware that for many of you Nigeria has become a place of abiding challenges limiting your ability to see a bright future for yourselves. 

Remodeling our precious national home requires the harmonious efforts of all of us, especially the youth. Working together, we shall move this nation as never before. 

My running mate, Vice President-elect Shettima, and I understand the challenges ahead. More importantly, we also understand and deeply value the talent and innate goodness of you, the Nigerian people. We pledge to listen and to do the difficult things, the big deeds, that put us on the path of irreversible progress. Hold us firmly to account, but please give us a chance first.  

Together, we shall build a brighter and more productive society for today, tomorrow and for years to come.

Today, you have given me the greatest honor you can bestow on one man.

In return, I will give you my utmost as your next president and commander-in-chief. Peace, unity and prosperity shall be the cornerstones of the society we intend to build. When you gaze upon what we shall accomplish in the coming years, you shall speak with pride at being a Nigerian.

I thank you all.

God bless you all.
God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

If as an individual, I can't hit the street, I won't encourage anyone to hit the streets. It will never come to an end without blood sheds and destruction of livelihood. Those blood suckling demons are always ready to shed blood.
3/1/23, 7:13 AM - +234 806 092 4290: OK. That's understandable. Thanks
3/1/23, 7:14 AM - +234 806 566 2895: You still don't understand that change often comes at a price

You want it but underestimate the cost. That's the difference between you and those you're trying to wrestle power from, they completely understand the cost and are willing to pay it...you aren't
3/1/23, 7:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: If my children and this country will become what I hope, what is one life?

Don't you believe in heaven again and a better life there? Why are you so scared to lose this?
3/1/23, 7:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: *what is my life?
3/1/23, 7:23 AM - +234 803 692 8469: My dear friends,

Presidential election has come and a winner declared for Nigeria. Let’s do our part to all make Nigeria work better for us all.
We may have wished other candidate wins, this elections, sentiments of all sorts can never be excluded and I respect all sentiments displayed.
We have a new big name in Nigeria politics now (LP, PO) having National Assembly seats and maybe gubernatorial and state assembly seats. This is commendable and unprecedented.
Whilst we lament and consider legal means of redress let us still join hands and work towards a prosperous Nigeria.

God bless 🇳🇬.

3/1/23, 7:25 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Words of weakness and fear. The number of under 5s and maternal mortality from incompetent government  will be more than the deaths from a revolution in the long run
3/1/23, 7:26 AM - +234 703 656 1230: That's Rubbish. So u are proud to represent a rigged elected candidate????
3/1/23, 7:27 AM - +234 803 281 3842: This is Nigeria politics for you. Do the unthinkable to get into office and then give a patronizing statement. So, make we rest till another election when the same non transparent process will repeat itself. How did we get here?
3/1/23, 7:27 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I just tire
In other words, you won some seats in the house, try again in 2027😏
3/1/23, 7:29 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Nigeria is only bad when it doesn’t support the person’s agent. When it does,it’s God bless Nigeria.

I only owe Nigeria one thing now and that is to preserve her future today, by fighting to get LP mandate. That we can assure you we will do.


This message as written by your humble self,  I'm not sure would have applied to you, if the tables were the other way round.

The country was almost set in flames because of a CBN policy that didn't favour your principal.

Only Righteousness NOT Evil will exhalt Nigeria.

We cannot say Long Live Nigeria, when it's foundations is embedded in lies and deceit characterized by a rigged elections

Nigeria will only live long if she out lives this season of deceit and is founded on the truth when the true results are established.

	PRESS RELEASE

GENERAL ELECTIONS: POLICE CONFIRM OFFICIALS IN VIRAL VIDEO TO BE INEC ENGINEERS, NO ARRESTS OR SEIZURE MADE

The Nigeria Police Force wishes to debunk, in strong terms, the trending news in the media confirming the arrest of some individuals in Maitama, Abuja, with electoral materials and some Bi-Modal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) machines, by operatives of the Nigeria Police Force.

Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), acting on a tip from residents of an area in Maitama who reported suspicious activities, visited the location, interviewed the occupants, and conducted a search on the house. In the course of the search, some electoral materials and BVAS machines were discovered in their possession. However, the Independent National Electoral Commission, when contacted, confirmed that the occupants of the house are staff of Emperor Technology, outsourcing engineering services to the INEC, and they were immediately released to go about their lawful business. 

The Force, while urging well-meaning members of the public to discountenance the false and misconstrued narrative being spread by some sections of the media about the arrest of these individuals and their link with BVAS manipulation, charged reporters and media houses to endeavor to do due diligence and ascertain the veracity of the information on the public space before spreading such to avoid being victims of the “breaking news syndrome”.

Furthermore, the Nigeria Police urges all and sundry to avoid the creation and spread of misinformation and disinformation which is capable of causing disaffection between the populace and state actors more so as we are at a critical and sensitive moment in our democracy. 

Thank you.

3/1/23, 8:37 AM - +234 703 985 5168: Numbers 23:19 (KJV)  God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
3/1/23, 8:46 AM - +234 703 985 5168: I am not speaking as a brazen prophet.....but let's all know that some mere men ( mortals) have just pitched a tent against God's sovereign will for the Nigerian nation.
3/1/23, 8:48 AM - +234 703 985 5168: .....The Almighty God will right this wrong! In his own  devine ways!

3/1/23, 9:31 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Or you join the cabal and be one of the landlords!🤣🤣🤣🤣
3/1/23, 9:38 AM - +234 703 656 1230: No they didn't. APC was announced winner based on highest votes and that's it
3/1/23, 9:40 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Is this possible? He must have gotten the 25% minimum in at least 24 states
3/1/23, 9:41 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Obikili with the massive turn out this election and still it was stolen from the masses.

Till now the masses voices is not being heard. Corrupt INEC chairman is on the throne doing his bid. Pls at what point are we going to get this country away from the hands of crooks?

Is it when am 50 and sure that their generation have all gone to meet their maker????

When????
3/1/23, 9:42 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Exactly. When as tenants there are tenants and there are tenants......... at this level our own level of tenancy na mud houses no be even better house sef
3/1/23, 9:44 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Even if u stand in front of Mahmood and shout this one he'll just look at u and say next......... just like he did to Dino
3/1/23, 9:44 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Bottom line they don't care
3/1/23, 9:46 AM - +234 817 950 7218: ARISE TV HAS GONE OFF
3/1/23, 9:47 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Wow
3/1/23, 9:49 AM - +234 817 950 7218: There is the option to leave if you aren't satisfied with your day to day life 

For me I'm coping okay and I like my country

We will stay and continue to push
3/1/23, 9:49 AM - +234 806 568 3004: I noticed 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
3/1/23, 9:54 AM - +234 806 329 9675: Continue to push and play with PURPORTED FIRE!...
3/1/23, 9:56 AM - +234 817 950 7218: I don't know why people are soo afraid

And you guys claim to be religious

Do you really believe in God and heaven?

If you do, why does death scare you so much? 

I don't think you guys really believe these things you say
3/1/23, 9:57 AM - +234 806 329 9675: *One leg-in, leg-out syndrome...*
3/1/23, 9:58 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Lol
3/1/23, 10:00 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Help me see matter o🤷🏿‍♂️
3/1/23, 10:11 AM - +234 810 006 7926: Let's leave this matter abeg.
3/1/23, 10:18 AM - +234 806 092 4290: If you and Rowland will be at the forefront when the revolution starts but not in the hospital to treat the wounded ones, then there's no problem.
Heaven will not be opened to you because you died fighting a just course for your country. Rather, it will be opened to those that have lived their lives serving God and humanity with love, humility, integrity, fairness, loving your enemies, praying for those that despisefuly use you and persecute you, doing what you can to make peace.
As a human and Nigeria, I would want to fight for what is rightly mine, but while fighting may give me immediate satisfaction, it may not give me the victory I so crave for.
There might be a revolution, there might be civil war, people will loose their lives and properties, and may never get the Nigeria they crave for.
3/1/23, 10:25 AM - +234 803 774 1554: 😀LOL.... Wa Inna ilahi rajiun...
3/1/23, 10:27 AM - +234 806 092 4290: The corruption in Nigeria is so systemic that most of the people that will still come out to fight or send people out to fight are only doing so for their selfish interests. Imagine someone like Dino "fighting for Nigeria". Revolution may take down the head of the government, but will it stop the corruption all over?
We have seen how many governors and politicians from the SE and SS fought for APC and PDP
3/1/23, 10:31 AM - +234 806 566 2895: What is love for humanity if not fighting for a better country for others, where they won't be kidnapped, pillaged, given good education and not die from common diseases? That's a worthy sacrifice of one's life...go ask Martin Luther King. His faith drove him. It's a wonder we claim the same faith but ours causes us to cower

If there's no realm of your mind that considers a fight for freedom, protest, whatever you call it, a possibility to extricating ourselves from our current quagmire then you may need to look up history a bit.

Many countries went through this and almost none achieved a revolution without bloodshed. But I know, as far as it isn't yours...

Whatsapp messages and analysis only go so far.
3/1/23, 10:41 AM - +234 817 950 7218: There won't be a civil war. That much is clear, because there isn't a tribal war or people who want to fight themselves

This you have said is the African mentality and I think that perhaps it's something innate to the black man

We have some inherent weaknesses that make us more likely to be suppressed even though we have the ability to stop it

If you look at Ukrainian war. Russia is much stronger that them, they knew from the beginning that they could win the war

But there's this thing called self pride and human essence. The Japanese commit suicide following defeat in battle

Some humans have a very strong wills and purpose in life and do not fear death

Like I said before death is inevitable. It is the end of us all. Some people don't see it as a reason not to have a stance or purpose
3/1/23, 10:44 AM - +234 817 950 7218: You miss the point. Nigerians are inherently corrupt. 

But functional governments are not because people aren't individually corrupt but that people are collectively aware of their power and their rights

Trust me, if the people rise up against these people. The power immediately shifts from the elite to the masses and it will stay that way 

It has happened numerous times in history
3/1/23, 10:45 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Evil thrives when good men turn a blind eye to it simply because it serves their purpose.
3/1/23, 10:46 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Thank you. A dysfunctional government is leading to numerous deaths. Little children, helpless women, numerous victims

Deaths are happening and in the long run I suspect that the deaths from a revolution would be less than the deaths from continuing with this charade where our economy will be consumed by a few thieves
3/1/23, 10:49 AM - +234 817 950 7218: It's because we don't value the lives of the people and we aren't seeing them while they did helplessly in the hospital

We don't understand that lives are being lost.

Look at the number of people avoidably killed from societal attacks in plateau and Benue

We have Shettima, a known terrorist entering aso rock and you think more lives will not be lost?

You're from Benue abi? @2348060924290 

Do you know what will become of Benue with Shettima and El Rufai in the corridors of power in the next 4 years?

You are trying to avoid uprising now but the after effects are much much worse for everyone in the country
3/1/23, 10:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Exactly. It's a question of quick or slow death. Death is even physical, what of the mental aspect? 

Some people think it's about offering in church and attending service 3 times a week, and that's the all God has on his checklist 

In the end these questions na him baba God go ask us. When people dey fight for a better future for all, you were checking channels tv and AriseTV, all the while preaching of the beauty of heaven wey you dey fear go
3/1/23, 10:54 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Gbam! 

In the end more die from misrule than during a revolution
3/1/23, 10:54 AM - +234 803 626 2734: In the spirit of fair play........... All Nigerians should congratulate the president elect...........Lets move ahead.

Campaigns are over...

Lets get to the real business.........Holding politicians to the jugular......... and making sure they deliver on their promises.
3/1/23, 10:55 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Oti zeh nioo
3/1/23, 10:57 AM - +234 806 566 2895: As you hold Buhari wetin him deliver for you? 😏

3/1/23, 11:02 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Baba try dey take your meds on time😂
3/1/23, 11:05 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Hold Tinubu accountable, pesin wey no vote?
3/1/23, 11:18 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Where are exactly do you people get off with all these patronizing comments?

I lost count of the number of times people had to contribute money to rescue our colleagues or their families from kidnappers. I’m certain those affected still suffer PTSD. 
That’s all thanks to a government that failed in its responsibility to its citizens.
Now, another broad daylight robbery has just occurred. Yet, you say let’s move ahead and play fair??? Has anything ever been fair in Nigeria?
Was this election fair? 

Just let people mourn in peace.
3/1/23, 11:22 AM - +234 803 626 2734: Disrespect us for training you........ Mumu

3/1/23, 11:24 AM - +234 803 626 2734: Immediately APC win we go collect all the plots and houses you have in makurdi...... Ewu
3/1/23, 11:26 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Which fair play?
3/1/23, 11:32 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Don’t mind him.
3/1/23, 11:34 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
Baba you suppose know sey these kine things no dey vex me

You're welcome to try though. I don't have a piece of land in Makurdi though
3/1/23, 11:50 AM - +234 803 626 2734: 🤔🤔🤔🤔....... Your father na very good man.........humble and caring.

I know no where you go get this your stubbornness.

Mushkla.
3/1/23, 11:52 AM - +234 806 566 2895: He's not humble and caring is debatable.😃

I've known him longer than you.

Just mecheonu for politics matter, you too dey mis yarn
3/1/23, 11:59 AM - +234 803 626 2734: My personal sincere political view. 

It mustn't align with yours. 

If truth has become misyearning to you.......... I would continue upholding it for the rest of my life. 

For the records.....

 Obidients are the most insultive political party in Africa...... and you are one.
3/1/23, 12:03 PM - +234 806 566 2895: Proudly...

Keep supporting your body and soul snatching party that has killed whatever we were managing in this country

For the record, I would rather have a group of "insultive" kids intent in progress than old men enriching themselves at everyone's expense or those who are in diaspora giving us advice on what to stomach or not to stomach

3/1/23, 2:15 PM - +234 803 281 3842: My bro, I was also shocked by my Yoruba sister who japa-ed to America , saying on Tinubu’s mandate she stands. She only supports him because he is Yoruba. I also acknowledge that most Igbos support Peter on a tribal basis only. Tribalism is an endemic problem in Nigeria. We often only see tribes in politics and marriage, and even the most educated of us are culpable of this. Yet we are the first to criticize racism when we travel abroad, as if we don’t know that tribalism is the local synonym of racism.

3/2/23, 1:23 AM - +234 803 626 2734: What we are doing on this platform is rather very very destructive to the entire set.

We can't keep on doing this. 

We can't keep on staying on the left wing. 

We are not politicians.

We are medical professionals.

I am sincerely very very angry with the person that introduced this rubbish here.......because it has no benefit. 

We have classmates with masters, PhD and fellowships. 

What we should be doing at this stage of our life is to come together help ourselves. 

What we should be doing is to come together and plan how to lobby positions from the government for our qualified and learned classmates. 

We have people in government that can lobby positions for our us.

We have people that know people on this platform that can lobby positions for us......... But unfortunately we keep on pushing them away......... By this position we have taken on this platform. 

We sincerely need a rethink on this. 

The average age here is 40............This is our prime........Let's ttop this destructive behavior..........do things in the right way.
3/2/23, 1:33 AM - +234 803 626 2734: We have done very well for ourselves by studying medicine......

We have done well by Obtaining higher certificates.

But sincerely that is not everything about life. 

You can have all these certificates and still won't be able to occupy a position that will enable you to help people around you..... If you don't have the right approach to life.
3/2/23, 1:43 AM - +234 803 626 2734: When the physician to Kogi state government started that discussion......... It was a very good opportunity to engage him.......... On the the way forward.......... But unfortunately............ Emotions took over our reasoning.
3/2/23, 1:46 AM - +234 803 626 2734: When people like Adams, Damiete........come here.......... What we should be discussing with them is........... The plan they have for the set........
3/2/23, 2:05 AM - +234 803 626 2734: I love you all..........

I am very very sorry if you feel offended in any way.........by the position I took in the past. 

My previous comments were general comments.......... not directed at anyone............. 

I also have forgiven all the people that have insulted me on this platform......

I hold No grudges......... Deep down. 

God bless you all. 

Goodmorning.
3/2/23, 2:20 AM - +234 803 692 8469: @2348036262734 
May God bless you and grant you more wisdom.
3/2/23, 2:26 AM - +234 803 692 8469: I clearly remember when some tried to discourage us for bringing politics and religious discussions here but some others felt everyone is entitled to his/her discussion opinions.

Here we are today.

Good morning.
3/2/23, 4:22 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Please can a neutral person come and summarize and explain what has happened here

Who offended who?

Who did what?

In my head we've been talking about politics and analysing all that happened 

People have been upset about how the elections were conducted etc


I don't understand what Akera is saying, but I can see some people agree with him

I will recommend @2348065683004 , you tend to follow the chat here

Was this an unhealthy discussion over this period of elections?

Should we not discuss politics?

What inappropriate things were said?

I'm honestly confused
3/2/23, 4:23 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Or @2348065370692
3/2/23, 4:23 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The major problem I've had was the sharing of fake news and I rarely open or download any of the videos here

Was there anyone offensive?

3/2/23, 4:31 AM - +234 806 566 2895: 😂😂😂
Baba free the matter, we are talking about the fate of millions and how we can improve the country for millions, baba dey interested in cashing out and jockeying for positions in a government that stole elections? 

Man! That's just unbelievable.

Is money everything?

Nuff said
3/2/23, 4:34 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Well, I don't understand or agree with him. But you see someone liked all his messages and another came out to hail him and then many who tend to agree keep quiet

I, you and TI have been vocal to a degree

So we are on one side of the divide

If there is a division there are people on the other side

So I will like someone in the middle

Maybe @2348065683004 or @2348065370692 who has followed the discussion to explain if there is really a divide or if discussions here have been unhealthy

Because honest to God I don't see it

But I might be blinded by something
3/2/23, 4:35 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Before my submission, may I know who this is?
3/2/23, 4:35 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Dariya?

3/2/23, 4:36 AM - +234 803 310 4903: Akera this your submission is null and void. 
The politics of Nigeria affects us all. 
That’s the reason why U are not in Nigeria presently. U are already a victim of bad governance. 
We cannot be oppressed and depressed at the same time. If you don’t want to speak cos u don’t want to lose useless friends in government who cannot do anything for you, it shows you are on the wrong side of things. 
You want your kids to grow up in this kind of Nigeria where u wld have to know a classmate to move forward in life?? 
Baba this your submission is null and void. 
We will continue to speak until we see real change. 
And for all those of you benefitting from these rogues in government that would see white and call it black.. pleas be aware that you are also not going to be in government forever. Your children will also be affected by the Nigeria you build today

3/2/23, 4:37 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I Will not consider making my submission
3/2/23, 4:37 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Doesn't worth it
3/2/23, 4:38 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Akera thanks for your opinion but it doesn't matter
3/2/23, 4:38 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Well said

Sadly, this so difficult to see

People positioning themselves for juicy spots in government, saying nothing the evils the government perpetuates simply because they're cashing out is what he's advocating

That's just sad
3/2/23, 4:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Is there anyone having birthday today or celebrating. I really wish to type something meaningful in lieu of my intended submission to Akera talk🤣

3/2/23, 4:47 AM - +234 803 626 2734: If to say you and TI the work with government........ I for know wetin to tell una. 

You guys are paid by foreign governments and organizations. 

Bode you need to calm down...... You are supposed to be one of our leaders....... But your comments are not encouraging at all. 

I have work at all levels in Nigeria...

Local government

State government

Federal governmen

I work with NGOs

I have a very good idea of what is happening in Nigeria
3/2/23, 4:48 AM - +234 803 310 4903: So because I’m not working for the Nigerian government Nigerian problems don’t affect me?
3/2/23, 4:49 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Akera one question. 

Do you need a job ? That will pay you in foreign currency?

Are you tired of working for Government?

Then start a new way of thinking.

With what I have seen you dropped there.. it only shows one things ..

You are tired of where you are but also you have become complacent and now operating at the mediocrity state
3/2/23, 4:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: There are many options to be paid in foreign currency
3/2/23, 4:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Leaving the country is one of them. Dare to be different
3/2/23, 4:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: What on earth nonsense was that, talking about people causing damage?

3/2/23, 4:51 AM - +234 803 097 7516: You said average age is 40
3/2/23, 4:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And you think any one should be able to manipulate a 40 year old adult
3/2/23, 4:52 AM - +234 803 097 7516: To cause damage
3/2/23, 4:52 AM - +234 803 626 2734: My message is very simple.......... So many people on this platform need help.........

If you feel you dont need help because NGO is paying you well....... Or your family it well to do.... That is good.

But allow people that need help on this platform to access it.

Thank you.

3/2/23, 6:17 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Pls Akera I have a question. 

If they had so much influence as u say, why didn't they start by ensuring in their various States 

1. Elections were free and fair?

2. People like Wike didn't lock up all the BVAS and election materials 

3. Ballot boxes were mot snatched? Cos the guy that was stabbed who ran with a ballot box was from Kogi

4. Stop people like Yahaya Bello from digging and abandoning roads that connects to people in other LGAs where people were waiting to vote

Many more questions but let's start with these...
.......
3/2/23, 6:26 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Since you're aware of what is happening in Nigeria
Bring your family and yourself back to Nigeria
 Come stay here for at least 2 years after enjoying the amenities abroad, then come back and have this conversation again after u have experienced what we are saying.

3/2/23, 6:35 AM - +234 803 626 2734: My village is one of my priceless possessions................my grand father single handedly made it what it is today
3/2/23, 6:35 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Good morning all,
I woke up to this lengthy discussion emanating from Akera’s submission.
1. It’s a sad day if as classmates and friends, we can’t have discussions,debates and even arguments, while yet having the utmost respect for one another. I should respect you enough to allow you express yourself and I don’t necessarily have to agree with you,but our conversation can be without putting each other down. That’s what civility is all about.
2. I dont think the intention of expressing oneself is meant to make anybody feel unwelcomed. AAA has always been a good sport about these debates, which are usually cerebrally enriching. However, I apologize if anybody feels unwelcomed because politics is being discussed,it wasn’t the intention. I know that if you bring up a more comfortable discuss, we will all pitch in.
3. This platform helps us stay in touch, one with another. It really shouldn’t be a big deal to call up anybody you need a favor or assistance from. My Titan colleague doesn’t need me always agree with him to help me. 
4. I agree that we can organize and use the positions we have attained in society to push certain agendas and plans, but that is not being hindered because we talk politics. Our political position is not the basis of our unity here and one must not expect that we should submerge our individual political position in order to achieve anything. I doubt AAA and Damietta will refuse to participate in any worthwhile agenda we bring forward as a group,simply because we don’t agree with their political patrons.
5. Let’s try to demarcate persons from the political position. We don’t have to be disagreeable because our political positions differ.
3/2/23, 6:58 AM - +234 817 271 4735: Yes, my daughter
3/2/23, 8:46 AM - +234 806 568 3004: Good morning Friends, 
I think we should all calm down. 

It's a political season and we can either take sides or sit on the fence. 

Regardless of what you decide to do, it is important that we respect the opinion of each other. At the same time, we should be respectful when making our submission, knowing that the elections and the results are very touchy issue for a lot of people on either side of the divide. 

Elections will come and go, but we remain classmates. I know different people have different views about the conduct and outcome of the elections but we should please not let the tensions get high. 

It's fine to express reservations about the outcome of the just concluded Presidential election, but let's remember that as some people are saying the elections didn't go well, other people are happy with the outcome. We should not start the court case here and divide ourselves. 

I have gone through the chats and feel some people were a little extreme in the comments and began to personalize comments. 

I appeal that we should all be calm. I believe we all want the best for Nigeria regardless of our political views, affiliation and interests. 

Let's pray that regardless of how this political season turns out, Nigeria will win in the end. 

Let us be tolerant of each other but also ensure we dont intentionally prove others either because of their candidates lost or won. 

As doctors, we are intelligent and enlightened persons, so we should be able to are peacefullly and not resort personalizing the issues. 

Let's forgive each other and move on. The political gladiators will fight there battles. The best we can do it support with our votes or comments but we should not start fighting dirty, calling names or demean each other. 

Let's forgive each other for any hurtful comments that may have been made and let's remain optimistic that Nigeria will win in the end. 

It should not be necessary for us to stop people from commenting. We can still discuss politics as intellectuals without issues. 

I think the discussion that heated the group were not too extreme but we should be cautious of how others will feel. 

If you really think it is necessary to go on the offensive with someone about the elections issues then make a call or send a DM. 

It's fine to celebrate your candidates victory or mourn if you candidate lost. If you think you candidate was won or lost fairly or otherwise, you can express that opinion respectfully. 

This platform is not a court for us to share evidence about how the election went so let's share only what we think is informative and beneficial and not something that will trigger people who are either celebrating victory or those coming to terms with the outcome of the elections.

After the political seasons, we will still have each other so let's not end our friendship unnecessarily because of our political views or affiliations. 

Remember to use calls or DM when necessary. Let's not bombard the group with top much information but please share information respectfully as some people may get information from what you share. Please also verify everything before sharing on the group. It will be embarrassing to have anyone here sharing 'fake news'.

I hope this calms all frayed nerves and reminds us to be tolerant and respect each other.

I wish you all a pleasant day and look forward to insightful and meaningful discussions on this platform. 

Thanks for reading and apologies for the long message. 

Francis

I want to appreciate everyone of us here both active and silent for bearing with all that has been happening ...

I also want to sincerely appreciate those that have kept this group very active this period ... I must say that I got updates and prompt reviews of the election from this group much more than any other group I belong to ... 

I also want to recognize that much discussion here were geared towards support for a particular candidate without much regard to others who supports other candidates ... While I completely understand the emotions, we must not destroy relationships ...

We should be able to agree to disagree without becoming enemies ... No Love lost!

3/2/23, 11:28 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Worthy of mention:

I want to welcome Akera back and appreciate you for forgiving those that hurt you before now, I also pray that those whom you hurt and insulted previously forgive you too ...👏🏾👏🏾

I must also appreciate AAA for his matured way of handling issues thrown at his Principal ... Mehn, Adams you dey try ... Cos that your guy dey collect from your friends here wella☺️☺️☺️

I see a beautiful maturity at play here these period and I pray we build on it and increase it ...
3/2/23, 11:29 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Please Dear Titans:

- Please let's us all make effort to always speak without hurting each other

- We should be able to speak up about a hurtful comment made to us or at us 

- We should know when to apologize and move on 

- If any of us needs the help and support of another, we should not hesitate to reach out ... I believe we will all be out brothers and sisters keepers

- Together we will succeed and make progress!!!
3/2/23, 11:38 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Help that comes at the expense of denying one’s convictions and constitutional rights is no help at all. It is called BRIBE!
Honestly, I can’t help but spot some God complex in your comments. 
What makes you think that you won’t be the one needing help? What if others were to hold you to your comments or judge you by your own standards?

I earnestly pray that Nigeria doesn’t happen to you.

I had an interesting conversation recently with a representative of a global brand and suffice to say that most international organizations rely 50-70% on social media.
You and your principal would do well to utilize social media to disseminate information of your “good” works, because those who depend on social media for their information are plenty and the numbers will continue to increase. 
Just a thought.

3/5/23, 9:34 PM - +234 703 013 1067: DR ONYECHIIKPEAZU, SAN. The Labour party lead Attorney to challenge the Presidential Election results in Court. He has never lost any case in his life
3/5/23, 9:34 PM - +234 703 013 1067: Biography
Born in Onitsha, Anambra State on 15th April, 1959, trained in the United States of America and attended Evanston College, Lake Forest College and Oklahoma City University where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Juridical Science in 1982 In 1984, he was called to the Nigerian Bar as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu has been in active legal practice till date and has served as Chairman of the Onitsha Branch of the Nigerian Bar Association and a NEC (National Executive Council) member of the national body, NBA. In recognition of his advocacy skills in 2002 he was conferred with the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria, (SAN) and in 2007, he was honoured by the Federal Republic of Nigeria under President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua with the National Honour of Officer of the Order of the Niger, (OON). He is a fellow at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and is also a member of the Nigerian Body of Benchers. Some of the landmark cases handled by Dr. Ikpeazu include MOJEKWU V. MOJEKWU; MOJEKWU V. IWUCHUKWU preserving the inheritance right of a woman; NGIGE V OBI reported in (2006) 14 NWLR (Part 999) 1, a decision that brought Mr. Peter Obi to office as the duly elected Governor of Anambra State. His adroit display of rare forensic advocacy skills led to the trail-blazing decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the case of OBI v INEC (2007)11NWLR (Part 1046)565, which case effectively re-calibrated the election metric rule in the hitherto uniform quadrennial elections into the office of Governors of States in Nigeria. Consequently, a candidate who was wrongly kept out of office after an election he rightly won, would still enjoy un-interrupted his four-year tenure guaranteed under the extant Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with effect from the date he took Oath of Office as the Governor of the State, barring such other circumstances as death and impeachment. Dr. Ikpeazu conducted the defence of INEC in several election Petitions including the Presidential Election Petition that arose from the General Election in 2011 He also led the defence of INEC in several Governorship Election Petitions arising from the 2015 General election, including;
RIVERS STATE
AKWA IBOM STATE
DELTA STATE
ABIA STATE
EBONYI STATE
ENUGU STATE
BAYELSA STATE
EDO STATE
He equally led the team of lawyers that represented Senator Ademola Adeleke in the Osun State Governorship Election Petition Dr. Ikpeazu is also a lead counsel in several State Governorship Election Petitions and appeals arising from the recently concluded General Elections 2019;
OGUN STATE
AKWA IBOM STATE
RIVERS STATE
ENUGU STATE
EBONYI STATE
ABIA STATE
CROSS RIVER STATE
OYO STATE
IMO STATE
He is also part of several Senatorial and National Assembly Election Petitions across the country. Besides election cases, Dr. Ikpeazu has also provided legal representation in International Arbitrations across several jurisdictions. With regards to criminal cases, Dr. Ikpeazu has successfully defended notable individuals in allegations of crimes, among them are Hon. Justice Adeniyi Ademola, former Judge of the Federal High Court, and Late Justice Umezulike, former Chief Judge of Enugu State.

3/6/23, 6:44 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Impressive....

Why VT???

Could it be SVT with aberrancy??

What would you expect from ECHO?

Suggest other possible investigations to help in management
3/6/23, 6:46 PM - +234 806 939 9882: It's not SVT look at the wide QRS. I also think there is a LBBB looking at V2

Not sure of echo findings here
3/6/23, 6:47 PM - +234 706 647 6470: I feel the AV dissociation and the fusion beats(beats 8 and 9) rule out the SVT.
3/6/23, 6:48 PM - +234 813 034 5709: Men wey get stuff!
3/6/23, 6:48 PM - +234 813 034 5709: Stuff!
3/6/23, 6:49 PM - +234 806 939 9882: In SVT you will have a narrow  regular QRS
3/6/23, 6:51 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Ehmmm

Not really.....

Looking at the morphology of the QRS, from origin to peak (either of the R or the S) is >100ms (2.5 small boxes). This can be seen in antidromic SVT, but not in any SVT using the conduction system, which is usually the case with SVT with abberancy. 

The presence of a negative axis in the apical leads (V4-6) is suggestive of VT as well, though can also be seen in SVTs in patients with a prior apical infarct. So that is just suggestive. 

Pretty much the presence of fusion beats, capture beats or AV dissociation proves VT.
3/6/23, 6:52 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Check beats 8 and 9

3/6/23, 7:00 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Impressive thoughts 

Very interesting real life case.

Let me get your thoughts on what to do.

Where facilities are available.

Because currently, this patient, a young promising man, ... Is fighting for his dear life.

Would you suggest ACLS(***DCCV).

WHAT OTHER INVESTIGATIONS would you suggest bro
3/6/23, 7:02 PM - +234 806 939 9882: He is unstable; history of loss of consciousness, systolic BP less than 90. He would benefit from cardioversion
3/6/23, 7:10 PM - +234 803 658 2567: <Media omitted>
3/6/23, 7:16 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Great 👍!!!

Great again....

Thank you!

So where facilities available... AED( which we don't even have one in JUTH) I learnt we have them on the streets out there...

We stabilize this patient with a Synchronized( since it's a monomorphic VT) DC cardio version with 200J...and progress...

IV Amiodarone ( which we don't have in Nigeria, I only saw one in Babcock where I did small interventional training) 300mg over 1hour and 900mg over the next 23 hours

Where patient can't tolerate amio, we could give mexiletine ( which we don't have in Nigeria)


Maintain the patient on IV amio 400mg BD for atleast two weeks ...

Step down to 200mg ...

Do an EP study.

Bubble contrast echo or TEE to rule PARADOXICAL embolus( we don't have in Nigeria)


In other words, this patient may just be ready for life after death.

The Nigerian storyline.

God gives and takes would be the final burial statement.
3/6/23, 7:17 PM - +234 806 088 5748: We can do TEE in lasuth
3/6/23, 7:18 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Lovely...

Dr Oladimeji said so but it's work in progress.

I am aware of Lasuth.
3/6/23, 7:19 PM - +234 806 088 5748: Present  day in lasuth
3/6/23, 7:19 PM - +234 806 088 5748: Was hoping to see you during the last cardiac mission
3/6/23, 7:19 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Perhaps, this out class of titans and those in government as Akera suggested can work towards donating a functional ECG machine in our A AND E, and an AED machine for JUTH
3/6/23, 7:20 PM - +234 806 939 9882: You have done well with what is on ground chief.
3/6/23, 7:20 PM - +234 706 647 6470: I was engaged with politics 😅😅😅
3/6/23, 7:21 PM - +234 706 647 6470: We didn't do anything....

Read through the story line.

Very soon na futile CPR , to massage our conscience
3/6/23, 7:21 PM - +234 806 939 9882: But this things are affordable it's just misplaced priorities by those in authority.
3/6/23, 7:21 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Titans, let's donate AED to JUTH oh!
3/6/23, 7:21 PM - +234 806 939 9882: 😮
3/6/23, 7:21 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Yes sir
3/6/23, 7:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: We don't have an AED in JUTH?
3/6/23, 7:22 PM - +234 803 281 3842: AED isn’t that expensive. We have one in my hospital and it’s a private hospital
3/6/23, 7:23 PM - +234 803 281 3842: A mainly O and G hospital
3/6/23, 7:23 PM - +234 810 006 7926: It's what primary schools have
3/6/23, 7:23 PM - +234 706 647 6470: E SHOCK YOU??
3/6/23, 7:24 PM - +234 706 647 6470: We have in JUTH, only in ICU store , basically used for accreditation exercises.
3/6/23, 7:24 PM - +234 803 366 5200: I'm sorry, but do we really need an AED for synchronized cardioversion?
3/6/23, 7:25 PM - +234 706 647 6470: The one in A/E, it's Mal functioning.

After the advent of CoViD 19, we are now seeing more thromboembolic phenomenon in the young....

Very common now.

Let's be careful
3/6/23, 7:25 PM - +234 803 366 5200: Cause an AED is actually not for use in established hospital settings i.e by health personel, but rather for use by bystander CPR providers
3/6/23, 7:26 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Wake up Master
3/6/23, 7:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: You really need to wake up
3/6/23, 7:26 PM - +234 706 647 6470: <Media omitted>
3/6/23, 7:27 PM - +234 803 366 5200: I've done done alot of cardioversion where I trained with the normal defibrillator, u just need to use the synchronisation button; so as to deliver the shock on an R-wave
3/6/23, 7:28 PM - +234 803 366 5200: I think I'm really awake on this one chief
3/6/23, 7:29 PM - +234 810 006 7926: As per where and where it should be located?

Seemed like you were playing politics with health it would seem
3/6/23, 7:30 PM - +234 706 647 6470: <Media omitted>
3/6/23, 7:30 PM - +234 810 006 7926: I'm in!
3/6/23, 7:31 PM - +234 803 366 5200: Owk I get u, buh the issue is do we really need it for DC cardioversion??
3/6/23, 7:34 PM - +234 706 647 6470: Its monomorphic VT , normally AED would sync to R wave and shock.

If polymorphic, then just shock.

At the end it's just semantics bro.

I brought this up to bring Nigeria to you in post COVID ERA where thromboembolic phenomenon is increasingly becoming prevalent
3/6/23, 7:35 PM - +234 803 366 5200: Owk, I get it, thanks
3/6/23, 7:36 PM - +234 706 647 6470: *Titans, let's donate AED to JUTH oh!*

3/7/23, 3:36 AM - +234 805 346 8639: Nope this is not Dr Dakum
3/7/23, 4:02 AM - +234 803 097 7516: His brother.
3/7/23, 4:02 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But apparently the state believe he worked for APC in the last presidential election
3/7/23, 6:15 AM - +234 806 566 2895: I don't think so
3/7/23, 6:17 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Dr Dakum is a great guy!! A man who has been at the helm of an institution such as IHVN and groomed it to the level it currently is surely understands the rudiments and practicality of leadership
3/7/23, 6:19 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I do not know the other candidates pretty well or their antecedents so I may be biased in my assessments. Dakum seeking governorship is probably the icing on the cake for his career and I want to believe he means well
3/7/23, 6:23 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Deliver the guy on a platform without baggages, that is how you get yourself a performer. 
APC and PDP's baggages of corruption and others can not permit good governance
3/7/23, 6:29 AM - +234 703 656 1230: If am going to vote, I am not voting this Dakum guy

As far as am concerned, he was not the LP candidate who won the primaries under labour party. He lost the primaries in his own party which I think was PDP, then went to LP bullied the candidate and convinved the party to pitch him instead and now the case is in court

This Dakum guy never even see the seat, but his so hungry for power that he's willing to do anything for it. That's to say when he gets there, Plateau go see Shege pass Lalong
3/7/23, 6:48 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Plateau is very fragile right now and needs a candidate who is ready and I mean really ready.

Looking at the 3 candidates APC, PDP and LP...... honestly I choose to look beyond the party for this governorship elections

PDP just want to return to power cos its been out of their hands for so long and to me its all on selfish interest...... no offense 🙏to the supporters in the house.
3/7/23, 7:20 AM - +234 803 979 5623: It's not so Patience. He's a good guy. 
It's interesting to see people's perspectives though...
3/7/23, 7:22 AM - +234 803 979 5623: So what to do?
3/7/23, 7:48 AM - +44 7466 095552: Hmm… a scenario was foretold where people would use the momentum of LP to pursue their own selfish interest.
Lots of people seem to have good things to say about this guy sha and finally, na intention wey  matter. 
Who would your alternative be of the 3?
3/7/23, 8:17 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Nentawe to me is the strongest of the 3 the problem is he's in the wrong party
3/7/23, 8:18 AM - +234 703 656 1230: How did u quantify that?
He should have accepted defeat and support his other party member. 

Am sure the people who didn't vote him for primaries saw beyond what we are seeing
3/7/23, 8:20 AM - +44 7466 095552: Nobody wants to see APC in plateau ooo
3/7/23, 8:21 AM - +44 7466 095552: By being in apc i already feel he won’t  have sense when he enters 😃
3/7/23, 8:22 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Exactly that's the issue and I totally agree that why I said the problem is he's in the wrong party
3/7/23, 8:22 AM - +234 703 656 1230: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ik
3/7/23, 8:26 AM - +234 703 963 4888: One factor remains constant in politics and that is sentiment. Sentiments vary depending on the prevailing circumstances and the sentiment of an average well informed Plateau Man is securing the state and the future of Plateau. With that in mind and as it stands today on the Plateau, PDP as a party has the lead considering the antecedence of the party's leadership especially that of former governor Jang in the state. 
Dakum is good but he won't win. The contest is between Nentawe and Mutfwang. I will still prefer Mutfwang dropping sentiments aside since Mutfwang has been tested before unlike Nentawe who has never held a political position in the past. The devil u know is better than the angel u don't know.
3/7/23, 8:43 AM - +234 703 013 1067: Well spoken @ Pattie just to say that Dakum was in APC until after he lost the primaries to Nentawe, he then moved to LP.
3/7/23, 8:45 AM - +234 703 656 1230: OK tot it was PDP
3/7/23, 8:48 AM - +234 703 714 8734: <Media omitted>

3/7/23, 9:01 AM - +234 706 815 1299: ✅👌🏼
3/7/23, 9:02 AM - +234 706 815 1299: This is a very objective assessment and my line of reasoning as well.
3/7/23, 9:04 AM - +234 903 277 5777: I am not against your opinion but this idea of "the devil you know....." Is like defending a thief because you know him.
3/7/23, 9:05 AM - +234 706 815 1299: His elder brother, but in a way, he is ours ours, cos he is also a medical doctor. He was commissioner of health/information in plateau state or so during Dariye's time
3/7/23, 9:08 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Nonetheless, all three contenders for the seat of the governor in Plateau State this time around are men that appear sound enough to carry the task on ground. Whoever that wins is a win win for Plateau, unlike previous elections where we are battling between competence and sentiments.
3/7/23, 9:08 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Hmmmm didn't want to go that angle too. That's why I kept mute
3/7/23, 9:10 AM - +234 703 656 1230: I didn't feel his impact then. Dariye's time na to dey dash money. They didn't do jack

3/7/23, 9:13 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Well, you may freely opine so, but Dakum has distinguished himself in the public health sector where he is head and in charge for many years now, unlike when he was under Dariye as commissioner. That has given me the confidence to give him my support and vote
3/7/23, 9:31 AM - +234 703 656 1230: What are his achievements cos me no see
3/7/23, 9:45 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Biko, I don't want to drag case for any politician right now, but IHVN have executed many projects under his leadership which you can find out from their website.
3/7/23, 9:52 AM - +234 803 693 5215: Bodeeeeeeeee!
😲
Who ask u dis?
Lols
Adawa things😃
3/7/23, 10:00 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But na just wetin I hear I talk o
3/7/23, 10:03 AM - +234 703 656 1230: IHVN has funders that give them money to do the work.

When working for international bodies, it is mandatory to execute what they've asked you to do..in essence u no get choice for the matter.

Global Fund funds IHVN and they detect what the money should be used for.

That's not attributed to jis efforts..... Mashor if he doesn't play by their tune, they get someone who will


What personal project has he executed on his own funded by him for his people in Plateau

3/7/23, 10:47 AM - +234 706 815 1299: Like I said, I have no time to advocate for any politician in this election because all three contenders for the governorship race in Plateau State are equal to the task, in my opinion. However if you don't understand the gravity of the capacity building that comes with managing resources prudently, with monitoring and evaluation at international standards (which is the key ingredient lacking in our public service), then I don't know how else I can debate this matter with you at this time. Is your candidate going to manage the state with his money or monies generated from IGR and FG allocation? Would you not rather have someone with much experience in managing resources under international monitoring to preside over project conceptualisation, implementation and spendings of the state?
That is not to say he has not done many things for Plateau State with his money, connections and influence. But pls pls pls, I not get time for media engagement for any of the candidates, other than PO whom I felt compelled to campaign for due to what i felt was at stake if he doesn't win. I only corrected notions that I felt were not correct that eventually dragged me into all of these. You can list what your candidate has done to convince undecided voters here, I won't argue with you. But my stand and basis for support to Dakum is clear.
3/7/23, 10:49 AM - +234 706 815 1299: But if *you chose not to understand*, is a better phrase to use here, because I know you actually understand, but only just want to project your candidate and that is allowed in politics.
3/7/23, 10:56 AM - +234 703 656 1230: A candidate with much experience yet could not do anything as a commissioner. If he couldn't do anything then who's to say he will as a governor. Mind u international is different from Local (Naija).
3/7/23, 10:57 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Point of note am here to convince u to vote anyone other than your candidate I only stated my reason for not voting urs.
3/7/23, 11:05 AM - +234 706 815 1299: That he didn't do anything as commissioner is totally not correct.
3/7/23, 11:06 AM - +234 703 656 1230: List what he did now....... I don't get.  What did he do????
3/7/23, 11:07 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Mashor I think at this juncture I opt out cos I see you're taking this personal. Am not interested and may not even vote on Saturday.

This one weh u dey carry the thing for head 🤣
3/7/23, 11:08 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Abeg oh am not interested in anything further concerning Dakum abeg

3/7/23, 11:12 AM - +234 703 656 1230: Hehehehehehehe 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3/7/23, 11:13 AM - +234 706 815 1299: And for you to wave off international level experience in a governorship contest like this is seriously surprising to me. I am not taking anything personal oh. I am only trying to find a way of running from here to continue battling with writing paper to help me in my promotion ni oh. That's y I don't want to dig deeper. 
However list what your candidate has done and I will list mine later, since you're pushing me into it eventually.
3/7/23, 12:12 PM - +44 7466 095552: Bro, international level of experience in what really? Managing IHVN doesn’t count abeg. I feel patience is asking a valid question. Where is the manifesto, let’s start with that. 
And saying his brother is one of ours kills your argument from the start. Abeg don’t menton that again. 
A variation of Aesop’s fable warned us that when the axe came into the Forest, the trees said "The handle is one of us”. We all know how that ended
3/7/23, 12:39 PM - +234 803 458 5862: Please let us come out and vote PDP. Dakum is from my place but... Let us just vote PDP
3/7/23, 12:45 PM - +234 803 458 5862: Mashor, voting LP in the guber polls is as good as voting APC. That's their strategy this time...to split votes in favour of their candidate. They are the ones encouraging Obidients to vote LP so that they can cash out on the division.
Like I said, Dakum is from my place and a Hippocratic colleague but I can't reward APC indirectly. Haba jama'a
3/7/23, 12:55 PM - +234 806 158 7077: This election should not be about parties but the pedigree of the candidates.

3/7/23, 12:58 PM - +234 706 815 1299: Your argument will only encourage Patience to tell me to go ahead with my Labour since it will favour her candidate in APC. I am surprised that you would also say that international exposure doesn't count. For other reasons, I may reason with you, but not for the fact that international level exposure is not counting. No please.

3/7/23, 1:51 PM - +234 806 158 7077: Nentawe is vast and very sound too. He will do well if he is given a chance. Let's not write him off cos he is contesting under APC.
3/7/23, 1:52 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Succinctly put. Nothing to add Sir!!
3/7/23, 1:52 PM - +234 703 985 5168: No doubts Dr Dakum has carved a niche for himself in public health leadership, management and governance.
3/7/23, 1:53 PM - +234 706 815 1299: ✅👍🏼
3/7/23, 1:54 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: And he told you that?……

3/7/23, 1:56 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: If you sit down with thieves long enough, you will begin to justify the art of theft. Evil communication corrupts good manners!! I understand the need to run on a political platform.
3/7/23, 1:56 PM - +234 803 458 5862: Nentawe taught in my secondary school. I have sat with him for 2hrs... besides, he is Tinubu's campaign director Plateau state so...
Some things I won't say here
3/7/23, 1:57 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: But let me warn as always, when you vote a man of integrity who decided to run on the platforms of Bulabans!!! Over time, he will be forced to defend the actions, caprices and doings of the bulabans whether it favors his people or not. Like they say, you don’t talk when eating. He may have good intentions ab initio. But the long run is what we are talking about
3/7/23, 1:57 PM - +234 703 656 1230: Infact you have hit the point. 🤝
3/7/23, 1:57 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: We all saw how conflicted Lalong was when he was offered DG of Tinubus campaign
3/7/23, 1:57 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Did he refuse it eventually?
3/7/23, 1:58 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In the end the will of the party superceded whatever the people desired because he must also protect his own interest
3/7/23, 1:58 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Let’s be wise
3/7/23, 1:58 PM - +234 703 656 1230: 🤝
3/7/23, 1:58 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I am not sure I can point to what Plateau gained by having a Gov that was aligned to the centre
3/7/23, 1:59 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In this time and age I doubt it has been an advantage per day
3/7/23, 1:59 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: I might be wrong
3/7/23, 2:00 PM - +234 703 656 1230: A man so hungry for power can sell his soul to get it. U lose primaries now run to another party and put the candidate out. Pls how desperate can you be??????

3/7/23, 2:02 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Anybody on this page campaigning for LP is indirectly working for APC. We joined hands to work for Peter Obi as President and not for LP
3/7/23, 2:05 PM - +234 703 656 1230: Exactly..
Peter Obi was never about the party..it was solely about his integrity. If he came under another party, people would still vote cos it was never about the party.

This LP candidate thinks people will go and vote LP cos of PO hahahahahaha. Why didn't he go to another party asides LP. Rather wanted to use the influence of Obedient followers 🤣 e go shock am.......
3/7/23, 2:06 PM - +234 817 271 4735: Just the way a lot of people came to power under bubu in 2015.
3/7/23, 2:08 PM - +234 706 815 1299: So I am eventually working for your candidate. @2347036561230 . You see😜

3/7/23, 4:04 PM - +234 706 815 1299: That's not right and I won't want to go into what happened at the APC primaries before he left and joined the labour party. (The videos have been made public, go and verify😜).

Here is a rundown of what his exposure at international level brought to plateau and Nigeria.

-Dr Patrick Dakum is the CEO of IHVN - Started the NGO with about 5 staff, now more than 1000
- Has provided employment for more than 300 plateau indigenes
- has been providing scholarships to numerous students
- Has been supporting widows and orphans in his immediate community and beyond
- Has worked with National and International agencies to Bring HIV care to Nigeria
- Lobbied and Set up Plateau's State Virology Research Center PLASVIREC
- Used his international connections to drill more than 200 boreholes
- Has been supporting family growth through his leadership in Couples' fellowship 
- has provided guidance and support for families through his Popular Radio Show - Home Front
- Through his efficient Leadership, he built two magnificent towers to house the International Research Center of excellence in Abuja
- He has provided guidance, and mentorship to more than 200 youth through his mentee platform
- He loves the growth and development of Children and has taught in Sunday School for the past 35 years
- To make his organization more effective, he reduced the average age and employed mainly teeming youths
- He believes in the power of women, hence most of the Leads in his organisation are women.

How can we overlook all these on the basis of some sentiments 🤷🏽‍♂️

It's like u dont understand how international bodies function...... I really don't know how else to enlighten u.

With or without Dakum, HIV care cannot stop in Nigeria....... bros he's not the one bringing such care to Nigeria

Abeg Bode and ko where una dey. Help me na abeg

Secondly if the fund allocated is to renovate 200 PHCs for example under his watch, he will have to deliver.  So Bros these 200 boreholes weh u dey talk so......... research again

3/8/23, 12:46 PM - +234 703 714 8734: BVAs LATEST UpLOADS  EXPLAINED.

Take it like this. You make a transfer from your bank account to another. Once you've done this,  between the time it leaves your account and hits the other account, nobody can interfere with the process.
It's technology. 

The algorithm of that software incorporates block-chain technology and does not give room for interference once the process is initiated. This is to ensure tamper-proof transmission of results.

INEC deliberately shut down the server on election day, after their supervisors gave most polling unit agents fake passwords.

When the polling agents tried to upload at the PU's, they couldn't log in. Very few who had been mistakenly given the right password logged in but the server was down so they couldn't upload. Nobody could upload results.

Word went round the PU's that the results could be uploaded offline. This was done in a good 75% of PU's nationwide. The idea being that, when the server is back on, they would upload automatically, just like making a post on Facebook when you are offline, when you come online, what you posted will automatically appear.

INEC did not know this.

The four Servers (hosted on AWS- Amazon web service) were turned back on over the weekend by INEC,  thinking they had fooled Nigerians with the fake results not knowing that the original results would be uploading automatically. 

Why is INEC suddenly uploading original results which contradict what they announced?
INEC has no control over the results that are automatically uploading right now, and they can't stop it cos the guy who was the original IT guru incharge of the system was transferred from that office to Enugu when they realized he could not be compromised.

This guy out of anger hid some of the details from them on sensing this grand conspiracy.

It is happening automatically and results show Peter Obi has an 80% lead.

INEC thinks they're smart and we dont know. In panic , they rushed to the Court to get a court order to "reset or reformat the BVAS " just like reformatting a phone to wipe every single thing on that phone but it's too late.  Is God not Wonderful?

iNEC sensing great danger rushed to court to restrain labour party from accessing this particular sensitive part  of the election materials, but the Court declined their prayers.

My friend at Amazon says though, that they dont need a court order for a reset. They're actually probably trying to WIPE the data from the server, and this is why they need a court order to give Amazon web services to wipe the data.

The court has restrained iNEC from resetting any Bvas.

People are going to jail straight from this place.

3/11/23, 9:54 PM - +234 806 675 1526: You live with your wife and the maid. One Saturday morning, your wife goes to the market. A while later, you go to take a bath to go out. The maid also takes the opportunity to go and bath in her own bathroom.

Whilst you two were in your  bathrooms, madam comes back home to pick the phone she forgot. Then the doorbell rings. Remember, you are bathing, but didn't know the maid was also taking her bath, so you continue with no worries and your wife was all along on the bell.

Not understanding why the maid is yet to get the door, you tie your towel, your curved tool making a bulge in the towel, you rush out of the bath and head to the door. 

Getting to the living room, you find the maid already opening the door with wrapper tied to her chest, sumptuous bossom popping through the lightly wet wrapper tied to her chest, curvaceous buttocks seeming bare in the very light ankara. 

Madam enters and sees the maid wet with wrapper tied around her chest, and you, oga, also wet  with towel tied around your loins...

Madam looks at you weirdly and asks what was going on, and why it took so long for both of you to show up, in that state, and together.
Now, your wife doesn't know what we know...

Something is not right here...

*PRESS RELEASE* !!
*PRESS RELEASE* !!!

Good morning all plateau indigenes, fellow Obidients and all labour party faithfuls. It has come to my notice that a purported letter going viral on the Cyber space that Dr. Patrick Sunday Dakum the labour party flag bearer for the gubernatorial election has stepped down for the peoples Democratic party'  candidate Mr Caleb Mutfuang. 

This is a falsehood orchestrated by Dakum's enemies, detractors and those who don't wish the state well. I stand to correct this anomaly and falsehood from the point of the PCC support groups plateau state and to assure all Obidients that Dr Patrick Sunday Dakum is still the man for the the Job, that he is still firmly in the race for the 2023 gubernatorial election on the plateau. 

I encourage you all not to allow this fallacy discourage your resolve to make plateau great again through the Labour Party and Dr Patrick Sunday Dakum. Disregard that letter because it was fake and still dead on arrival.i firmly stand with the labour party 5/5, with the support of our Obidient groups to fervently come out enmasse to totally deliver plateau from the shackles of backwardness and religious one-sided ness orchestrated by the enemies of the state.

Thank you and God bless you as you make a bold statement on Saturday 18/3/2023 with a victory song for the labour party.

Signed:

😀
3/19/23, 10:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: This ethnic card is very Unnecessary. APC on one hand does not represent the Yorubas perspective or position. APC has played this card strictly for political reasons. We are fanning the embers of war, and unfortunately it may consume the very people who were not even in the country when the last civil war lasted. Politicians who have married across tribes, are the very ones playing this card and their gullible followers leaves more to reason. The attacks on the Igbos in Lagos is highly condemnable and unnecessary as no Nigerian is more Nigerian than another. The question I ask, is if it were Tinubu's son who is married to half Igbo and half Lebanese were the one contesting for governor of Lagos, will this ethnic card be played? How does seyi marrying an Igbo make him 'un-yoruba'. How does the Adeleke's whose mum is Igbo, make him less 'yoruba' or less 'Nigerian' to govern. The Adeleke's family name is rooted from Ede Osun State, And this was never a question prior to the Osun election. I wander why it is in Lagos. Davido named his son Ifeanyi and we all felt his loss. Tinubu  is from Osun, married to Remi from Delta State, and yet Tinubu became governor of Lagos State, Remi Tinubu became a senator representing Lagos. Fashola, Ambode,Sanwolu( has a child outside wedlock from a woman in Delta) are not from Lagos, and I wander if this ever counted when Lagosians voted for them.

APC in my opinion has made elections climax to a point where thee most violent wins, the best cheat wins and the one who spreads the most falsehood. Under APC we have been divided the most among religious and ethnic lines.

Tinubu may never be sworn in and even if he does, it may be short-lived, and already the country is on the brink of a civil war. We have had the most IDP camps post civil war, even though we are not at war.

We must rejig our laws  and replace State of Origin with state of residence.

Any Nigerian can become somebody, without knowing anybody and can aspire for any office anywhere, so far you are competent and show capacity. It might be a tall order, but with the level of inter tribal marriages, we are getting there.

This lesson is not only for the politicians but for everyone in one place of authority or advantageous positions over others. It could be the way we treat our house helps, our gatemen, our subordinates, etc

1. Ekweremadu and Obeta had treated the man and other potential donors as *“disposable assets – spare parts for reward”*
2. They entered an *“emotionally cold commercial transaction”* with the man.
3. The behaviour of Ekweremadu showed **“entitlement, dishonesty and hypocrisy*”
4. Ekweremadu *“agreed to reward someone for a kidney for his daughter – somebody in circumstances of poverty and from whom he distanced himself and made no inquiries, and with whom, for his own political protection, he wanted no direct contact”*
5. *“What he agreed to do was not simply expedient in the clinical interests of his daughter, Sonia, it was exploitation, it was criminal. It is no defence to say he acted out of love for his daughter. Her clinical needs cannot come at the expense of the exploitation of somebody in poverty.”*

Note to the Lawpadi Network - March 22, 2023
 
  
PETER OBI & LABOUR PARTY V INEC, BOLA TINUBU, APC, & KASHIM SHETTIMA
 
For those who were wondering why we didn't send the newsletter out yesterday, well it's because we were waiting and hoping that one or both Presidential election petitions would be filed so we could do a brief analysis of it…and we were not disappointed.
 
Both of the leading opposition candidates have filed their petitions challenging the election of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and in today's newsletter we will be doing a brief analysis of the petition filed by Mr Peter Obi (PO) – as this is the petition we have been able to get our hands on. Once we get our hands on the petition filed by Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, we will do an analysis on that as well.
 
You guys will recall that in our newsletter a couple of weeks ago we did a breakdown of the election petition process in Nigeria. So, if you didn't read it or need a refresher – check out our article on the election petition process in Nigeria
 
 
The Grounds of PO's Election petition challenge
 
Ground 1 – That BAT was ineligible to contest the election.
a.  The first argument is that when BAT's vice presidential nominee - Kashim Shettima was nominated as the Vice Presidential candidate, he was still the Senatorial candidate for the Borno Central constituency. He only withdrew his candidacy a day after he was nominated. PO is arguing that since Shettima was nominated in Borno central constituency, and then nominated in the 'Nigeria' constituency (regarding the VP nomination), this is multiple nomination and therefore his nomination as VP is void , and therefore since his nomination was invalid, it taints the candidacy of BAT - and so he was therefore ineligible to contest the election.
 
What does the Law say on this point?  
 
Section 132(4) of the 1999 Constitution states that for the purpose of an election to the office of President, the whole of the Federation shall be regarded as one constituency.  Section 142(2) further provides that the provisions of the Constitution relating to qualification for election, tenure of office, disqualification, declaration of assets and liabilities and oaths of President shall apply in relation to the office of Vice-President as if references to President were references to Vice-President. In order words Section 132(4) should apply to Vice Presidents. Finally, Section 35 of the Electoral Act 2022 provides  that where a candidate knowingly allows himself to be nominated in more than one constituency, his nomination shall be void.
 
Lawpadi Verdict – This seems like a strong argument, if it is proven that the Vice Presidential candidate had a dual nomination at the relevant time. We shall wait to hear what the tribunal decide.
 
b.  The second argument is that BAT was charged and fined $460,000 for an offence committed in the USA involving dishonesty – narcotics trafficking in 1993, and a decree of forfeiture was ordered against him, and based on this was ineligible to run for the office of President.
 
What does the law say on this point?
 
Section 137 of the 1999 Constitution deals with what grounds make an individual ineligible to run for the office of President. Specifically, 137(1)(e) of the 1999 Constitution provides that a person would be ineligible to contest if within a period of less than 10 years before the date of the election to the office of President he has been convicted and sentenced for an offence involving dishonesty or he has been found guilty of the contravention of the Code of Conduct.
 
Lawpadi Verdict -  This does not seem to be a very strong argument, and we think it is unlikely to be upheld by the tribunal. This is because the case in the USA was decided in 1993 (30 years ago). The Constitution states it has to be a conviction within the last 10 years.
 
 
Ground 2 – The election was invalid by reason of corrupt practices or non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022.
a. PO's argument here is that INEC issued “Regulations and guidelines for the conduct of elections, 2022” and the Manual for election officials 2023. By these guidelines INEC officials were meant to do two key things:
Use the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for accreditation, verification, confirmation, and authentication of voters.
use the BVAS to upload a scanned copy of the result sheets (Form EC8A) and electronically transmit the result of the polling unit directly to the collation system and the result viewing portal (IReV) in real time.
PO argues that the uploading of the results was not done, which gave room for manipulation of the results, and therefore due to non-compliance with the regulations by INEC (which they set themselves) by failing, refusing and neglecting to instantly transmit and upload the result of the election electronically to the IReV from the BVAS, INEC did not comply with the election provisions. 
 
What does the law say?
 
Section 60(5) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that in an election the presiding officer shall transfer the results including the total number of accredited voters and the results of the ballot in a manner as prescribed by the Commission. Then in Section 38 of the Regulations and Guidelines for the conduct of elections, it provides that on completion of the election at a polling unit, the presiding officer shall use the BVAS to upload a scanned copy of the EC8A to the iREV. This is further backed up by Section 2.9.1 and 2.9.2 of the INEC Manual for Election officials 2023 which sets out in detail the procedure for the online and offline transmission of the election results to IReV. 
 
Lawpadi Verdict  – This seems like a very strong argument, we shall wait to hear what the tribunal decides.
 
 
b. PO further argues that INEC has refused to comply with the order of the courts to make available the election records in its custody. Specifically, they have denied having any Forms EC6A and EC8B from Rivers State; in Bayelsa they only provided Form EC8A in 4 out of 8 Local Government areas, and Forms EC8B in 7 Local government areas; they provided all the forms for Benue State; but then refused to provide forms for all the remaining 33 states and the FCT. 
 
What does the law say?
 
Section 74 of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that within 14 days after an application is made to INEC by any of the parties to an election petition, they must provide the documentation and failure to comply is a offence liable on conviction to a maximum fine of N2m or an imprisonment term of 12 months, or both. Further, the Supreme court already ordered INEC to provide the documentation. If they have not done so, then the INEC Chairman could be charged with contempt of court – which is a criminal offence. 
 
Lawpadi Verdict – This seems like a strong argument. However, this is on its own is not enough to invalidate the election, but it does create criminal liability for the relevant INEC officials involved. 
 
c. Finally, PO alleges that INEC failed to record the quantity, serial numbers and other particulars of results sheets, ballot papers and other sensitive electoral materials – as required by law to be recorded, in the States that BAT won. 
 
What does the law say?
 
Section 73 (2) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that an election conducted at a polling unit without the prior recording in the forms prescribed by the Commission of the quantity, serial numbers and other particulars of results sheets, ballot papers and other sensitive electoral materials made available by the Commission for the conduct of the election shall be invalid. 
 
Lawpadi Verdict – This is a very strong argument. If PO's team can conclusively prove that this was not done, then the law is clear that the polling units affected would be invalid. 
 
 
Ground 3 – BAT was not duly elected by majority of the lawful votes cast at the election
 
PO alleges that not only did BAT not score the highest number of votes; he also did not get at least one quarter of the votes cast at the election in the Federation and the FCT Abuja as constitutionally required. 
 
What does the law say?
 
Section 134(2) of the Electoral Act provides that if there is more than one candidate for the election, he/she shall have been duly elected with the highest number of votes cast at the election, and has not less than one-quarter of the votes cast at the election each of at least two-thirds of all the States in the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja 
 
Lawpadi Verdict – this is a novel issue of law on constitutional interpretation. It seems like a strong argument, but we shall wait to hear what the tribunal decides.
 
 
 
What is PO asking the Tribunal to do? 
 
So, what happens is that lawyers hedge their bets – they ask for one thing, and if one thing can't be given, they ask for something else instead, and if that can't be given, they ask for something instead of that as well…these are called alternate prayers. 
 
So these are the possible outcomes that PO has prayed the Tribunal for: 
 
Outcome 1
An order of the Tribunal: 
That BAT and Shettima were not qualified to contest the election.
That since they were not qualified, then all votes to them are 'wasted votes'
That PO had the majority votes and not less than 25% of the votes in at least 2/3 of the country and the FCT
That the tribunal should determine that since BAT failed to score 25% of the votes cast in the FCT he was not entitled to be declared the winner of the elections - OR in the alternative - The Tribunal should make an order cancelling the election and compelling INEC to conduct fresh elections where BAT and APC shall not participate. 
 
Outcome 2 
That BAT was not duly elected by the majority of lawful votes cast at the election and therefore his declaration as winner is unlawful, unconstitutional and of no effect.
That based on the valid votes cast, PO won the election
That INEC should declare PO as the duly elected President
That the certificate of return issued to BAT is null and void
 
Outcome 3
That the election is void and should be ordered cancelled, and that INEC should be ordered to conduct a fresh election.
 
 
In conclusion, PO has used all the three possible grounds to challenge the election of BAT, and it appears that he has a case that on the face of it has some merit. We will see how things develop over the next few weeks and months, and once we get our hands on Alhaji Atiku Abubakar's own petition we will share our thoughts - and also share our thoughts when BAT and INEC file their responses to the petitions.
 
Thank you once again for being a subscriber and see you next week!

Legal Term of the week -   'Prayer' 
 
In law, requests made to court to grant specific things are called prayers – yeah, not weird at all, lawyers call judges 'my Lord' already so calling the requests prayers is actually consistent with that.

3/26/23, 7:43 PM - +234 803 097 7516: There is alot going on around this. Apparently I now see more persons who tolerated this before changing their minds
3/26/23, 7:43 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Reasons? I don't know
3/26/23, 7:50 PM - +44 7459 768544: May God comfort you dear friend @2348035133391
3/26/23, 7:53 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Yes. “Trans regret” is a real thing. Unfortunately, the medical community caved into political correctness with regard to the whole trans thing.

The process of “transitioning” is fraught with complications many of which are irreversible. However, no one talks about it for fear of retribution. One of my professors tried to publish findings from his studies and they outright told him he could not. Not because his findings weren’t true, but because of the implications for the LGBT community.
3/26/23, 8:20 PM - +234 703 985 5168: My heartfelt condolences Dr Abdullaziz..
3/26/23, 8:21 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Just time
3/26/23, 8:24 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: I reviewed the results from that study, and any researcher would recognize the flaws in the findings. The study relied on self-reported data, and self-reported studies are often plagued by self-reporting bias due to social desirability and no doubt, that is a huge factor in this case.
3/26/23, 8:24 PM - +234 818 989 5529: My sympathy plz. 
May God rest mama's soul. Amen.
3/26/23, 8:31 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Any, these issues beg the question. Are we really dealing with nature or does it all boil down to nuture?

3/28/23, 5:52 PM - +234 806 954 1554: *COPIED*

Some years ago, the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital special project team approached the Deputy Senate President (Ike Ekweremmadu) to help them fast track the funding for a project in the Hospital though a government intervention prpject. He asked to submit their proposal and they did, it was 400million for Renal Centre. The N400m was to build the structure, procure equipment and train few doctors abroad for renal transplant and other special renal emergency training.
Ike Ekeremmadu asked them to double the money to N800m and the extra N400m will be for him to facilitate the release of the funds.
Ike Ekeremmadu later facilitated the release of 50% of the fund and diverted all of it even without the knowledge of UNTH.

After waiting for so long, UNTH made contact and was told they should submit the progress report for the project status in order to access the balance of 50%. Alas! They had nothing to show for the initial 50% and didn't even know that oga Deputy Senate President has taken N400m and moved.
On May 5th this year, Ike Ekeremmadu will receive his jail sentence for trying to do a kidney transplant in the UK for his daughter whose kidney failed... we know the story.

Ike Ekeremmadu pocketed N400m meant for building a Kidney Centre in his state where probably the daughter would have received a transplant without flying abroad and facing the stringent laws guiding organ transplant.

Who says God doesn't have a sense of humour?

*Don't joke with Karma.*

It's official - Nigeria is 'ruled' by idiots, retards and thieves
3/30/23, 8:11 AM - +234 803 658 2567: Lol @ "it's official" . 

Was it unofficial before? 😄

Some of us have moved on.  Just do your very best in your discipline, go on vacations, give yourself divine peace and wait for Nigeria to be put on Netfilix while you sit back and watch the comedy show😉

Do not allow these folks mess around with your mental health😎
3/30/23, 8:22 AM - +234 806 939 9882: Last line is the key
3/30/23, 9:12 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Lol! The patriarchy always wins.

Isn’t it interesting that in a time when feminists are crying for equality, trans women are being accorded the same rights as biological women? 

Trans women get celebrated for simply existing while women who have experienced all the ups and downs of womanhood are not even acknowledged.

Here in the US, they’re dominating women’s sports, being awarded “woman” of the year, getting million-dollar endorsement deals, etc. In fact in the criminal justice system, if a man identifies as female, he will be put in the female jail cell.  The patriarchy always wins!

Anyway, we’re living in very interesting times.
3/30/23, 9:15 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I totally share same sentiment. Just when women started getting to be accorded the right place and recognition, now they have to share that attention with the trans
3/30/23, 9:16 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Women thought men are misogyny, they need to hear what comes from the trans
3/30/23, 9:23 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: So true! Have you also noticed the trend in comedy? It looks like nowadays, all a man has to do is slap on a wig and make a caricature of women and voila! He’s a comedian.
3/30/23, 9:25 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Very true
3/30/23, 9:25 AM - +234 803 097 7516: At some point I was think most of them are cross dressers trying to hide under comedy
3/30/23, 9:25 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But as it is, is more of a caricature thing
3/30/23, 9:26 AM - +234 803 097 7516: With time we will have clarity but I'm afraid that being a woman had only become harder
3/30/23, 9:26 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Has*
3/30/23, 9:48 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Not necessarily. I think womanhood has become harder only for those who have refused to acknowledge God’s created order. 
Man was created to lead and woman was created to help man. Now, this in no way means that man is better than woman as they were both created in the image of God. We’re created to complement one another, functionally and even anatomically.
However, in a situation where women want to take on the roles of men, men will increasingly have to become effeminate. They’ll naturally have to take on the roles of women. In society today (especially in the western world) this is playing out both psychologically and physically. The logical conclusion of abandoning God’s order is chaos and everyone loses in the end.
3/30/23, 9:57 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: But notice, that even when men take on the roles of women, they’ll still dominate women, and that’s why I said that the patriarchy always wins. 
We cannot escape God’s order. 
As it is written in Genesis 3:16
when God cursed the woman. He said to her:
….”Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you."
3/30/23, 10:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Very true

3/30/23, 10:06 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I have never thought of it this way. This is nothing but the truth. The world is continually heading for self-destruction

So if 24 or 25 persons in my law firm show up, without Okon, have I had all the persons I wanted to see? The answer is NO. To satisfy my request, Okon must show up in addition to the 24, thus making the 25 persons I desire to see. Okon is a Constant; 24 Corpers is a variable.

4/7/23, 8:20 AM - +234 803 097 7516: The outcome of this is simple. The medical schools will be empty. Only in the North would people go to medical school in Nigeria.
4/7/23, 8:20 AM - +234 803 097 7516: But for the South, no point. Ghana, Cyprus, Ukraine, Russia, Benin and other would have an influx
4/7/23, 8:40 AM - +234 806 529 3872: Stupid Bill.
No employment opportunities for those that wanted to even stay in the country.
I know medical officers still employed as casual staff in Nigeria with ridiculous pay.
4/7/23, 8:59 AM - +234 803 313 0145: This guys are dump. How won't you know the sex of child ? When you can obviously see the genitalia.
Except off course u are dealing with intersex.

4/7/23, 10:22 AM - +234 803 281 3842: The left believes there are several types of gender-not just male and female. Biological sex is now debatable. Children are being asked to choose what sex they are..so, if a boy with male genitalia says he is female, they would approve for that below 18 year old to have testosterone hormone blockers and even gender re-assignment surgery. It’s wild.
A person can chose his own pronouns and you would be in serious trouble if you mis-gender the fellow( give a pronoun unagreeable to the fellow).
Yet, these children who can choose to re-assign their gender before turning 18, can not legally buy alcohol until 21 or vote.
It’s wild out there
4/7/23, 10:26 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Total freedom is anarchy. There will be anarchy if the freedom of every one is to be enforced. Next phase would be pedophiles asserting that they were born that way and demand their freedoms.

4/7/23, 12:05 PM - +234 806 092 4290: I hope medical school will be free for all potential doctors with monthly stipends. If this is the case and it is made an option then those interested can go for it. Any other thing is pathetic

4/7/23, 4:16 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: The hypocrisy of this bill is laughable!

The government will never do the right thing and then when the consequences of their inaction becomes evident, they resort to force. 

There needs to be a bill forcing their kids to remain in Nigeria, forcing them to never seek care abroad, etc
4/7/23, 4:22 PM - +234 803 281 3842: And why the attention on doctors alone?
Brain drain has affected all sectors of our society. More nurses migrate than doctors and the entire banking industry was heavily affected by recent drain of ICT experts. 
The number of Nigerian moving to abroad for studies increased from 8000 to 60,000 per, according to CBN governor. These are not all doctors. The lack of nuance on the real issues affecting the country is pitiful.
4/7/23, 4:26 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Politicians don't limit themselves to where they can seek health but limit the professionals to where they can train and possibly practice
4/7/23, 4:38 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: The reality is that the average Nigerian politician perceives themselves as belonging to a separate class of citizens. They have distinct laws for themselves and another set for the common people. This mindset of entitlement and habit of disregarding the needs and concerns of the masses, is what has created the problems in our country.
4/7/23, 6:05 PM - +234 803 313 0145: Doctors are singing it out.
Nurses are like current flowing from naija to us and Canada. But they are quite about it.
That's just one reason

1. Classmates Are Family.
- Avoid Things That Divide Family.

2. In Class You Would Always Be ABUBAKAR, EMEKA and ADEWALE etc Despite the PhD, SAN, Hon, Chief, General, Prof, Mr, Dr, Rev, Ustaz etc.

3. Check On, Reach Out To Classmates Who May Be Less Successful.

4. Achievements Are Processes Not Destination; Everyone Has His Time.

5. Class Groups Are Not Places For Intimidation But Co-operation.

6. Classmates Are Not Political Or Cabal Groups

7. Be Humble and Sincere With your Classmates, They Knew You When You were Nobody.

8. A United Class Is a Successful Class, No Matter Who Succeeds First.

9. Never Treat Classmates Like Employees..

10. Be Kind To Classmates, Table Can Turn in Future.

11. 💰 Money Can't Buy You Classmates' Support When You are In Trouble.

12. Forgive Classmates' Mistakes ,They are Human.

Many years ago I was working as a clerk at a faculty in one popular university in Nigeria, then I saw an advert for NDA (Nigeria Defence Academy), I have always loved to go to NDA so I applied, submitted my form and was called for admission examination.

I had to travel to Kaduna all the way from Osun State, I have a distant uncle that was resident there then. I wrote a letter (no telephone at the time) to my uncle that I was coming to sit for an exam in Kaduna and would love to stay in their house.

I didn't get a reply to my letter even as my departure date was approaching. I became so worried because I needed to go anyway, as I was talking to a colleague in the office concerning my fear of where to stay, our office cleaner who was a Hausa man overheard us and in his broken English interjected that he knew someone right inside NDA.

Who could he know there? *Is it not a cleaner like himself*, I unintentionally said it out to his hearing. "Oga no o, the commandant op za NDA na ma classmate and ma priend". In his bad handwriting, he scribbled the commandant's name on a piece of paper. "Just mention my name's por am, him go helf you."

I reluctantly collected the paper from him, not because I intended to make use of it but because I didn't want him to feel bad.

The next day, I set out on this long journey by train from Osogbo. I got to Kaduna a day later towards evening. Upon getting there, I went straight to my uncle's house only to find out that they had relocated from that place and no one knew their new address. I became stranded and it was getting late.

Around after 7pm, I made up my mind to give my cleaner's contact a shot. I got to the gate of NDA and mentioned the name I was given. To my utmost surprise, everyone in that bit, recognized the name and one person was promptly detailed to take me to his office.

I gave the paper where Kabiru wrote his name and that of his friend to the secretary who took it inside. On sighting the paper, the commandant shouted from the office and followed the secretary outside to usher me in. "Where do you know Kabiru?" "He's my colleague in the office, Sir," I answered. 
"Where is he? How is he? Hope he's doing well?" This man was asking me many questions in an obvious excitement. 

The look on his face confirmed to me that Kabiru was his beloved friend. He asked me what I came to do in Kaduna and I said it was for the NDA exams. "Wow, do you have where to sleep?" "No, sir." He immediately called someone to take me to his house. On getting to the house, I was lavishly entertained.

This man came late in the night and he woke me up and took me up on tutorials for the next day's exams. After the exams, he personally drove me to the park the next day.

When I got back to the campus, I began to look at Kabiru with a different eyes. How on earth does this man know such a powerful person? Needless to say, my name was number four on the list when the results came out.

Friends, I put it to you today that relationship is a currency. Every man needs another man to move up and that man may be the neighbour you look down on, maybe the taxi driver you so despise or even the house help you think is a nobody today.

Relationship is a stream of income. Everything in life actually reproduces on the basis of relationship. Those we know in life matter. *Most of us are talented but we need a cupbearer that will tell Pharaoh that there's a Joseph that can interpret dreams.* we need our old school mates irrespective of their status today.
Hook up with your class mates in the primary, secondary and tertiary schools alumni. 

There are some heights you may never get to in life until someone tells someone about you even in church or mosque. Therefore, shut the door on relationships gently. You may need to use it tomorrow.

Let us take our relationships seriously. Even if you meet online, don't look down on anyone. You never can tell which of the relationships will be your own key to success.

4/9/23, 5:11 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *The demystified Nobel Laureate* 

Gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in righteousness: the scripture says. 

That of Soyinka can be found in Agbado cornfields. 

The integrity-barren intellectual has suddenly found his voice. 

He maintained criminal silence when Mc Oluomo threatened innocent voters. 

But became vocal because Datti Ahmed spoke out. 

When a king becomes mischievous we must cover our faces with baskets and tell him the truth. 

Wole the compromised academician has called Obidients facists: A clear case of intellectually dishonest or inability to comprehend the meaning of Fascism. 

The dubious elder has shown where his bias and loyalty lies. 

A wise man once said — be careful the advice you receive from some elders because fools grow old too. 

The hypocritical Prof wants us to believe Obi's tape might be true but that of the Chief Justice meeting Tinubu is a lie. 

He is not worried about the criminal wire tap of a presidential candidate but is annoyed by how vocal the youths are. 

Our people say when the gods starts misbehaving; we will show the gods the woods where they were carved from. 

We must draw Soyinka unto the path of righteousness. 
For an elder does not stay at home while a goat gives birth tethered. 

He must realise the demand for change from the youths will continue until the right thing is done.

Again the question I wanted you to answer, since you were in the affirmative, that nothing will change in Nigeria

4/10/23, 9:26 PM - +234 803 097 7516: But before I go let me explain the types of political loyalists in Nigeria politics
4/10/23, 9:34 PM - +234 803 097 7516: 1. Passionate followers with no relevance to the political circle : this set of people are driven by the goal of their goodwill for the candidate of interest and party . Usually they are either newly recruited political converts. They are non card carrying members. Just an individual with passion. They make enemies for no immediate or future gain. 

Politico-technocrat: None aggressive political followers with link to the political middle: less active, docile people with interest. They have some relevance to the political cycle. They are either indirect donors and funders. They are often card carrying members waiting for the breakthrough of party. They make no friends or foes. They guard their heart and have no permanent interest cos of a imminent future of theirs 

Full politicians: full time politicians with clear ambition. They lead the race, express interest, run the race, usually cheered by group 1 and funded by group 2. They know the place of group 1 and the place of group 2 people.
4/10/23, 9:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Abiola we operate at different group, that's why you would see some ranting obidients and none ranting obidients 🤣🤣. Your spectrum of operation is clear and people like you are always needed to keep the political fire burning
4/10/23, 9:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Like APC has thugs and hooligans
4/10/23, 9:37 PM - +234 803 097 7516: LP is lucky to have educated version of that and not as condescending like APC
4/10/23, 9:39 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Let's know our group and class and keep our spectrum of operation functional without harrassomg others functioning in a different group and spectrum like us. 

The political sagacity needs everyone of the groups to function
4/10/23, 9:39 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Serve your group TOR sir I am serving mine.

4/10/23, 9:40 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Wander why a simple question has generated an epistle that 90 percent of members may not read
4/10/23, 9:41 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Members weren't asking. Only one member who wish to know

NO MORE JAPA FOR DOCTORS AND DENTISTS?!
 
As some of you would be aware, last week we heard that the Nigerian House of Representatives is trying to pass a Bill that would make it difficult for medical and dental practitioners to relocate from Nigeria. The Bill is sponsored by a member of the House of Representatives - Ganiyu Johnson, an All-Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker from Lagos (note he will not be returning to the House of Reps as he lost his re-election contest).
 
 
What is the Bill about?
 
The bill seeks to amend the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act 2004, and if passed into Law it will mandate all Nigerian-trained medical and dental practitioners to practice for a minimum of five years in the country before being granted a full licence to practice.
 
There have been concerns in recent times over the relocation of many healthcare workers in Nigeria to foreign countries. In August 2022, the Nigerian Medical Association said a total collapse of the health sector is imminent if urgent steps are not taken to address the brain drain in the sector. The association called for an emergency solution to the issue in the health sector, adding that with the trend of medical doctors leaving the country, there may be a need to hire doctors from foreign countries in the future.
 
Hon. Ganiyu Johnson's argument is that it is only fair for medical doctors, who enjoyed taxpayer subsidies on their training, to give back to the society. He said by working for a minimum number of years before leaving Nigeria to practice abroad, the country would have benefited from their skills.
 
 
 
Is the proposed Law a Good Law?
The rationale behind the Bill which is that – healthcare workers have their education subsidised by government and so they must 'pay back' before they leave, is an argument which could arguably be used for any worker in Nigeria who goes through the higher education system.
 
Yes, health care workers are critical to the nation, but one could argue that this is the same for other professionals, a lot of people are relocating – doctors, lawyers, engineers, IT workers, chefs, teachers etc. So why single just healthcare workers?
 
There has been a lot of discussion about the state of the IT systems in the banking sector, with a lot of IT workers relocating, some people are alleging that we are seeing more instances of fraud, network downtime etc. because of that. Could an argument not be made that because banking infrastructure is affected, then we need to regulate how IT workers relocate?
 
So, what if we start to see a lot of police officers leave the country because they are in demand in other countries – will we restrict them from relocating as well? One could argue they are even more critical than healthcare workers…
 
The point we are trying to make is this – if you accept Mr Johnson's argument about healthcare workers, you can take that argument to its logical conclusion which could lead you to accepting that almost every worker is important to the country and economy, and so the government should not stop at the health care workers, but extend to other sectors…and that leads us down a very slippery slope.
 
So, it is a good law? We don't know that's for you to judge; however, it does seem quite unfair to single out only health care workers.
 
 
What stage is the Bill?
The Bill just passed its second reading, and for those who have read our article here about how a law is made in Nigeria, you would know that there are essentially 11 stages to the process, and the second reading is just stage 5, so there is a still a long way to go before this Bill becomes a Law.
 
The next stage of the Bill is the Committee Stage, which is the most appropriate forum for people who are aggrieved with the Bill to share their thoughts. In the Committee stage, a committee is assigned to deliberate on a Bill to examine it more critically.
 
The Committee examines all aspects of the bill, and they also organise public hearings, where any member of the public or expert(s) having an interest in the Bill may be allowed to attend the public hearing and make contributions to the public debate of the Bill.
 
So, if you feel very strongly (either for or against the Bill), or hope to be a doctor one day, and you know this will affect you, you should look out for when the public hearing is held, so you can provide your input.
 
The next time the Bill can be killed is at the third reading, where another vote will be held, and so this is when all people concerned can reach out to their lawmakers and weigh on them to vote the will of the people.

Is the proposed Law unconstitutional?
A lot of the criticism that we have seen in the news is that this proposed Law if passed would be unconstitutional and a breach of the fundamental human rights of medical workers in Nigeria. A good lawyer could make a respectable argument that this law if passed would breach at least one fundamental human right (maybe more) - Section 34 of the 1999 Constitution, specifically in Section 34(1)(c) which states that every individual is entitled to respect for the dignity of his person, and accordingly no person shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour. The argument being that requiring medical students to work for 5 years before being given their license is forced or compulsory labour.
 
Unfortunately, we cannot say for certain whether such an argument would be upheld in court, because we do not know what the final draft of the Law will read, and if it were to be challenged the validity or otherwise would be up to the courts to decide.
 
Be that as it may however, we feel that a more than respectable legal argument could be advanced that such a law would be unconstitutional as it would appear that during that 5 year period, there is no specific additional training or knowledge that is being imparted as part of the requirements for the license, and as such it would be an evident legal mechanism to keep the health care professional working in Nigeria. Which one could argue is compulsory labour i.e. you are forcing me to stay and work when I have met all the medical requirements to be awarded my licence.
 
 
Will the Law be passed?
This is one to keep under watch, as we said at the beginning of this newsletter, they are in stage 5 and they have to get to Stage 11. This National Assembly will be disbanded next Month in preparation for the new lawmakers who will be sworn in, and so the National Assembly will need to move lightning quick to get it passed. It can be done – but it would be extremely tight.
 
A member of the public can make suggestion(s) on any aspect of the bill, but only a Member of the Committee can propose an amendment to the bill. All amendments that are made must be in line with the principle and the subject matter of the bill as agreed to at the second reading stage.
 
 
Finally – the Honour Code
If you have made it this far – then can we ask for a small favour? If you have enjoyed this (and our past newsletters) could you do us a huge favour and leave a 5-star review? It would really mean a lot to us. Click on the image below to leave the review

4/11/23, 2:40 PM - +234 817 034 1232: If they want to pass the bill let them pass it quickly 

So we move to the next level of destruction and dissolution of the country 

Anything APC does at this moment is good

Lol

4/11/23, 2:43 PM - +234 817 034 1232: *A devious chairman* 

Observe him. 

They call him Pa Lamidi Apapa. 

The man sent to hijack Labour party chairmanship. 

Some have said if he was vying for the position of an Ifa Chief priest or a native doctor at Iragbiji village– they can understand. 

He says Obidients are fully behind him: perhaps he meant Abiola and Bode who have given him their blessings. 

We shall examine his claims because Pa Lamidi seems confused on what to do with his new found power. 

He cannot withdraw the case in court as Peter Obi is the number one petitioner while LP is number two. 

His first diabolical mission has failed. 

He has no access to Party funds and cannot call the shots. 

When you jump from a shrine into civilisation, disorientation naturally happens. 

He has realised that hijacking the Obidient movement is more than incantations and administering agbo at the shrine. 

When Labour party develops spiritual problems we shall reinvite Pa Lamidi for guidance.
He is better suited for magical and fetish fights with APC and PDP. 

As events unfold the juju of the ignoble chairman will be exposed. 

The gods are observing closely.

4/12/23, 6:04 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *An exceptional Challenge*


Prophet Odumeje wants Prof Soyinka to debate him and leave Datti Ahmed alone. 

The battle line has been drawn. 

A war of words between Indaboksi Pahose and the Erudite Kongi is about to happen. 

Brethren grab your Oxford and Merriam-Webster dictionaries. 

Hopefully the debate will not turn to a deliverance session and our able Prof is flung away from his seat. 

Many believe the Nobel Laureate will win. 

They have said 'e no go better' for the motivational speaker who sent Prophet Odumeje on this suicide mission. 

But a proverb says: *a boy sent by his father on a mission to steal does not go about it silently, he breaks the door loudly with his feet*. 

Odumeje may have recieved divine revelation from the gods to challenge Wole. 

Soyinka should pick a date as requested. 

They have asked the prophet who will emerge winner. 

Well.... 

Our able Prof should come with his dictionary. 

He may hear strange words like 
'Gagandusa Gandusa',  'Abedo Shaker', Dabush Kabash, 'Lepremande Lamande' ....and recieve a technical knock-out during the debate. 

Soyinka wrote the book — The trials of brother Jero. 

Who knows? 

This debate might be the trial of brother Odumeje. 

The Professor's supporters say it will be a battle of intellect and grammar. 

The Prophet's disciples are reminding them, the spiritual controls the physical. 
A war against principalities and powers. 

The stage is set. 

Let the best man win.

They sent Prof Karshima Abina to straighten your path and mentor you into a wonderful doctor. 

As you celebrate this day: a proud father of 2 and hubby to a beautiful damsel – the Lord will continually guide you. 

The arrows of Tinubu and the swords of Shettima that fly day and night will never meet you. 

Happy birthday once again brother.

4/13/23, 10:32 AM - +234 703 656 1230: My question is 
Why was she still standing there to receive beating?

Secondly will FIDA truly hold him accountable?

Also it's obvious he's very afraid of committing a crime cos as tge lady passed out on the floor, he too became scared of the possibility of killing her and having to be on the run
4/13/23, 10:33 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I have been reliably informed that he has been arrested.

He was arraigned before the magistrate court 1 today.

She should have ran away and not stand there for him to keep beating her. See now that hit on her head with the bag turned worse than expected

I know it might be a long shot, but if each of us would spare a moment to post:

#air the election tribunal on live TV!

it might get to the ears of those who need to hear it.
4/13/23, 4:29 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Twitter is the best place for this
4/13/23, 4:32 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Yes. All those who are on twitter, kindly spare a moment to do that. We should make some noise on all social media platforms at this point.
Let’s not give up hope just yet. It’s not over until it is over.
4/13/23, 4:33 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Who knows what will come of it. But it is worth the try.

4/15/23, 4:03 PM - +234 806 537 0692: Nathaniel Nii Cudjoe Is A Ghanaian Not Nigerian Let Alone Eggon From Nasarawa State 
*** 
A video now trending claimed one Nathaniel Kudu, a medical graduate who bagged multiple awards at the second session of the University of Cape Coast's 55th congregation is a Nigerian of Eggon descent from Nasarawa State. A simple search on internet however confirmed otherwise. His real name is Nathaniel Nii Cudjoe and not Nathaniel Kudu as being speculated and he is a Ghanaian. 

Cudjoe who recently met with country's vice president, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia at Jubilee House, Accra, made headline when he swept 16 out of 22 awards at the just-ended congregation of the Ghanaian university.

Tinubu will be sworn in 

It remains to see where the supreme Court will swing


The Chief Justice will rule in favour of Tinubu because he is from the Southwest....it will take a miracle to upturn the election

4/16/23, 2:45 PM - +234 708 813 7766: Really? Not if the Nigerian citizenship is by birth
4/16/23, 2:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Bode is right. Even if you are Nigerian by becoming  a  citizen not by birth, that automatically confers you with dual citizenship ( the first which is the land of your birth and secondly the conferred citizenship as a Nigerian) and automatically disqualifies you.
4/16/23, 2:52 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Worst still is that it is claimed or alleged to be a diplomatic passport
4/16/23, 2:54 PM - +234 803 097 7516: Irrespective of how. You hold an allegiances to another country and you can't be devoid of conflict of interest in the event Nigeria has an issue with that country

4/16/23, 7:28 PM - +234 703 714 8734: Dino Melaye, a lawmaker who represented Kogi West Senatorial district and the spokesperson of 2023 Presidential candidates of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has been declared the winner of the PDP gubernatorial primary in Kogi State.As announced by the returning Officer for the election, Melaye scored 313 votes against Idoko Ilonah’s 124 votes.

Comments: There is no doubt that Mr. Abubakar Atiku was backing Dino Meleye's aspirations to the Governorship candidature in Logo State. The question to ask is whether a person can confer on another, what he himself has not. Atiku lost the presidency. any efforts he makes to Meleye gaining the Governorship ticket of the PDP in Logo State, will be feeble, halfheatted, flimsy and fanciful. Moreover Dino lost it, as a Senate contestant in one half, of Kogi State. How he will garner the whole state is baffling since nothing has changed. But we are all ears and eyes too, come the time! ... see more

4/16/23, 9:13 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Thank you for this AbdulSaheed. I think the constitution is very clear on this. The challenge however has been it's interpretation by Lawyers( like the lawyer, Mr Onyeakachi in this article)

You cannot be president of Nigeria if you have dual citizenship and that's why the INEC will ask presidential candidates if they have sworn allegiance to another country.

And to lie( as obtains in Tinubu's case), that you aren't is tantamount to perjury, which is another grievous offence

4/17/23, 9:22 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Condemnable, you can't arrest pastors because their prophecies does not favour your candidacy. Contempt for God and his prophets is a sign for an early demise of the APC
4/17/23, 10:01 PM - +234 803 281 3842: Please , let’s do sue diligence. Bros has a rape case and that’s what he is in jail for
4/17/23, 10:01 PM - +234 803 281 3842: *due
4/17/23, 10:17 PM - +234 810 006 7926: How convenient!, Few days ago another pastor who made prophecies not in favour of APC was arrested by the DSS.

If he has a rape case, he should answer for it and like you said with due diligence, he should have been served with a warrant of arrest.

It baffles me who comes first in defence of absurdity

Why are you consoling them
4/27/23, 6:06 AM - +234 806 092 4290: E pain me shaa. I be no want make City carry this league but e don be as e dey be.
4/27/23, 6:08 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Beating City at Etihad was always going to be an impossible task, but dropping points in 3 straight matches that they should have at least won two was where everything collapsed. The boys have tried all season sha
4/27/23, 6:10 AM - +234 806 092 4290: The coach is still young and naive. Even his mentor has learnt from his past mistakes. Sometimes, Pep now does a Mourinho just to get results, but Arteta will play one formation and tactics all season. Sad
4/27/23, 6:17 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Very true
He's not flexible
4/27/23, 6:44 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Now that they are collapsing criticisms just dey fly up and down. When they were doing well he was a chief tactician oh
4/27/23, 6:53 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Of course, he is to be criticised for not having plan B. When you do well, you are to be praised, when you mess up, you will also be criticised. That's life
4/27/23, 6:54 AM - +234 806 092 4290: The boys have tried. They are human beings. Legs are tired. So as a coach, you should anticipate all these and know when to adjust
4/27/23, 6:56 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Even City that has at least 2 sets of first team players still adjust. If you watched their second leg against Bayern, you will know that Pep now has different set ups for different games.
4/27/23, 6:57 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You can't give us all these hopes all season and shatter them like that
4/27/23, 6:58 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Imagine, Arsenal is going to be the first team to top the league all season till April/May and not win the league
4/27/23, 6:59 AM - +234 803 310 4903: You started well but ended this discussion like arsenal is tryn to end the season
4/27/23, 7:10 AM - +234 817 950 7218: If he had started changing tactics and losing

People will say, why did he change a winning formula

Shey una no see how lampard try new tactics yesterday collect for brenford hand at Stanford bridge

4/27/23, 7:19 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Lol.....why bring Lampard into this discussion now? We are talking about coaches not "legends" that want to motivate their club players
4/27/23, 7:19 AM - +234 806 092 4290: They have ended it already na
4/27/23, 7:21 AM - +234 806 092 4290: How do you lead 2:0 in two consecutive matches and draw them without learning from previous mistake?
4/27/23, 7:22 AM - +234 806 092 4290: How do you bench Trossad in all those matches because Jesus came back when he has been on fire all through before then?
4/27/23, 7:41 AM - Paul Ashir: The same reason why you are not a coach.
4/27/23, 7:43 AM - Paul Ashir: What formation prevents the players from committing errors leading to goals?
4/27/23, 8:09 AM - +234 806 566 2895: Trossard should not have been benched for Jesus

Arteta isn't flexible
4/27/23, 8:14 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We can have errors but when same errors are persistent, you have to change something. That's why you are a coach. Your opponents have been studying you and devised means of getting at you. You have to twist something
4/27/23, 8:15 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Look at the situation of Chelsea. Are you saying a better coach can't change the downward trends with these same players?
4/27/23, 8:16 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Aston Villa were going down and a better coach came in and he is doing wonders
4/27/23, 8:17 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I agree. Even if benched, he shouldn't be introduced late.
4/27/23, 9:10 AM - Paul Ashir: No matter wat u Twist, it is the players that need to stop making errors. The simple truth was that man City are getting their game plan with a large squad and arsenal is getting tired with a lean squad. 6 weeks ago, the game won't have been as lopsided. Arteta may be rigid, but his changes showed he can change. He did not bargain for Odegaard to lose the ball again 3rd game running and be punished for it. Until that error, arsenal had a chance.
4/27/23, 9:50 AM - +234 806 092 4290: You are right, but these errors were not prominent before now. The key thing is that Arsenal don't have enough squad strength. That's why, sometimes you set up your team to soak the pressure and defend, especially when you are two goals up. I didn't expect much from the City game but the previous 3 matches were there for the taking

4/28/23, 7:33 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Shows the power of culture

None of the players or managers are still in the team from the last collapse.
But the culture has been passed on to the next generation

Arsenal have a culture of collapsing in the key period of the season
4/28/23, 7:37 PM - Paul Ashir: Does that also mean Chelsea has the culture as well? They've also bottled 5x
4/28/23, 7:49 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Theirs is that they were top of the table for less than half the season

Normal title chase

4/29/23, 11:17 AM - +234 817 950 7218: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country

You can look through all your methodology details here.

This is world statistics website that provides accurate statistics globally about everything, not just IQ

It is fairly trusted

I know it always makes people feel bad, but I think there is sufficient evidence to conclude that intellectually Asians are at the top and Africans are at the bottom

That's not necessarily a bad thing, intelligence isn't everything and all we need to do is copy and we can be alright

But it's important we understand our strengths and weaknesses and make the best of what we have

PS - We are very good at running and dancing that should count for something
4/29/23, 11:19 AM - +234 817 950 7218: And don't worry, Nigeria isn't last.

We ranked 171 out of 199

Higher than 28 whole countries 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾


Of course it's a pity that despite superior intelligence we only rank above about 4-5 countries in most other indices

Further evidence that intelligence isn't everything
4/29/23, 11:22 AM - +234 817 950 7218: At least I had enough IQ to figure out that we had inferior IQ and Asians had the best before I ever heard or saw this statistic

I try

At least I suppose dey top half for Nigeria on the bell curve
4/29/23, 11:23 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Intelligence has several dimensions to it..several types to be exact..academic,social,emotional, entrepreneurial,music,arts/creative intelligence. It makes it difficult to objectively measure. Kanu nwankwo would probably not do well with your quantitative quiz but has very high football intelligence. Is his type of intelligence less than the math professor? The debate will rage on but Kanu’s earned him more financial value..
4/29/23, 11:24 AM - +234 817 950 7218: That's what we are good at

Sport

That is why blacks dominate sports and music

Perhaps we should leverage on that and become the entertainment capital of the world

The Japanese make mobile phone and pay us to dance for them

It's a win win situation
4/29/23, 11:26 AM - +234 817 950 7218: An IQ assessment has been structured in a fairly reasonable method

It has its criticisms but overall it gives a fair idea

It in no way makes us inferior to them, we are simply less intelligent than them on average
4/29/23, 11:28 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Again the study basically equated western education to intelligence. Asians  are more educated and that’s fact. They have the lowest out of school rate and that fact but I argue that education isn’t equated to intelligence. Fundamentally, where I disagree with the statistic. It measured level of western education, not intelligence
4/29/23, 11:30 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Alright. 

Well...
 Let's educate our people then and see where that takes us
4/29/23, 11:30 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: *spreads mat….. lays down* my neigbors good morning!!! This discussion will be interesting
4/29/23, 11:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: But if we go down that route

What will constitute African education?

The Asians will still beat us at the African education as long as it involves the use of brain and/or intelligence.

The Kanu Nwankwo example is more of Physical than the brain....even though you need brain for coordination on the pitch
4/29/23, 11:35 AM - +1 (415) 934-8891: While I have not read the article and would likely not read it. I can deduce one or two things from the exchanges so far. 

1. If the scale for measuring a parameter is skewed, the outcome naturally will be skewed!! 
2. I have come to the conclusion that whether in Industry, academia or politics. Global narratives will be dictated by the direction of interest of the story teller.
4/29/23, 11:36 AM - +234 817 950 7218: By my assessment in the pre-colonial era

The Asians displayed their intellectual superiority in being able to think and come up with environmental solutions

This spans from religion, to language, to writing, everything they did was superior

Then the west came and tried to take over, the Asians decided to learn the technology and capitalism and play the world dominance game

And less than 50years into it, they are obviously going to win and dominate the world

We in Africa barely even wrote

We were still drawing on walls or something when the whites came to teach us to write

We could speak of course, with a less than impressive vocabulary

I don't think western education is the issue
4/29/23, 11:36 AM - +234 803 281 3842: We should…but, is western education what we should be teaching?
Education arguably started in Africa-science ,medicine and architecture started in Egypt.. does the education we receive from the west enhance us as Africans or does it sell an agenda that options the west choose is superior? 
Take entrepreneurial intelligence for example, the Igbo traders have perfected an apprenticeship program that trumps any bsc or msc in marketing or business. Yet, the bsc is considered education and the Igbo trader isn’t?
4/29/23, 11:37 AM - +234 803 281 3842: *are
4/29/23, 11:37 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The west often tell the story

But they can't deny that Asians are better off

It certainly wasn't China that created that article

So this your analysis is dead on arrival
4/29/23, 11:39 AM - +234 817 034 1232: We wouldn't be having this argument if Nigeria was ranked somehow among the first 10


Your IQ may be above 106.48 which is what Japan as the number one has

But people who voted in drug Lords and terrorists may have dragged you down to 67🤣🤣

This is not to say that people with IQ above 106 did not vote criminals oh. Of course they did. These are outliers 

We just have to live with it.
4/29/23, 11:40 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Succint!
4/29/23, 11:40 AM - +234 803 281 3842: The Asians did not accept western education completely.. they created a hybrid of their traditional education and western education.
You can’t beat a spider at being a spider, no matter how long you study to be a spider.
Africa has to change the rules , else there is no getting out of the western shadow
4/29/23, 11:42 AM - +234 817 950 7218: We are an unfortunate experiment because certainly we should modify our curriculum and our ways based on what we need

Unfortunately we don't even have the sense to shift away from the one they thought us

So we haven't even started, we are even going backwards
4/29/23, 11:43 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Chibu you are comparing apples with oranges. People who thrive on the status quo, intelligently or not, tried to ensure that the status quo remains, in order to preserve themselves and their livelihood
4/29/23, 11:43 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Perhaps their ability to create hybrid education is what has put them above others in IQ ranking 

Since Africans refused to create theirs....they are at the bottom

Kenya is ranking above Nigeria in terms of IQ....and it reflects in other areas of their life
4/29/23, 11:43 AM - +234 803 281 3842: No lie here
4/29/23, 11:44 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay oo
4/29/23, 11:44 AM - +234 803 281 3842: This study just equated number of people with western education as intelligence
4/29/23, 11:44 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Unfortunately we don't even have the sense to start, we are not even doing the western education properly

Talk less of modifying it to something uniquely Africa


I agree with you

That is what we should do

But can we?

You need intelligence to figure some of these solutions out

I think our odds are better if we focus on dancing

We have governors like Adeleke all over the country

People come for tourism and pay us, the governor will be dancing for them at the airport

They'll say look, that's the governor welcoming us with the breakdance
4/29/23, 11:51 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Your savagery towards Adeleke is undeserved. His love for dance doesn’t affect his ability to govern.
Back to the matter..colonial domination put us in this precarious situation ..and now we are at a point that only a radical approach can turn the tide. I dare say that democracy as a system of government isn’t right for Africa, as it lacks the radical will or power to change the trajectory of Africa. The change must be radical and democratic processes cannot be radical
4/29/23, 12:01 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: In responding to my position, you have elegantly skipped the first point. And in addressing the second, have minimized “story teller” to mean the West. If it serves your purpose, that’s perfect. But for what it’s worth, I am certain you know that the Asians too have told their stories for centuries and this has been a major reason for the preserve of their culture. Africa is only waking up to the value of telling its story as a means to preserve culture. But then again your point is taken
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: The same “west” has put out narratives severally to demonstrate that Nigerian house holds in the US were some of the highest earners alongside Chinese households and Indians in some articles and also stating that Nigerian communities form some of the most educated immigrant populations in the US using reasonably acceptable parameters for measurement including number of persons with an advanced degree, income levels of households amongst others. 
Nowhere in those articles did they link this assessment to IQ. Why? Because a narrative needed to be driven at the time to influence immigration policies
4/29/23, 12:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Just to add to why the Asians have show some superiority to the Europeans and Americans, - Asian ideology believes in persistence and perseverance as key to solving problems wether academic or life situations whereas western ideology has evolved to advance the place of strengths and weaknesses at individual levels and hence the notion that you focus on your strengths and advance them. So while some children are supposedly gifted for maths others may not be. 
The Asian mentality believes in talents but also advances that with perseverance every child can go great at any task, maths, or arts inclusive. This perseverance culture is at the root of meditation for long hours
4/29/23, 12:33 PM - +1 (415) 934-8891: Also note that both idealogies have their merits and demerits but that’s a discussion for another day
4/29/23, 2:38 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup

I agree with you completely
4/29/23, 2:43 PM - +234 817 950 7218: The story teller in the case of IQ was not Asia

The analysis and conclusion is done by the west, unless I'm wrong and thus I'm saying that even the west with all their bias acknowledges Asian superiority in their analysis of IQ

That's why I said they often, and not always


Regarding the first point, you might need to explain more because I don't understand it

If the measuring is skewed, the scale is skewed

I assumed you were speaking of Onuhs explanation reducing the validity of the whole idea of an IQ test

I think I had responded to that already, to the best of my knowledge, we are yet to find a more objective way of assessing intelligence

But I strongly suspect that no matter the method used, Africa will still carry last

But like I said, it's not such a bad thing

Intelligence sometimes is kuku a burden

We all know ignorance is bliss
4/29/23, 2:45 PM - +234 817 950 7218: But the ideology of the superior race is showing results
4/29/23, 5:48 PM - +234 810 006 7926: Absolutely!

I have not and would never underestimate Nigerians. They are one of the smartest people in the world
4/30/23, 5:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Yup

Genetic disadvantage
4/30/23, 5:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Good luck to him. I hope he gets the 100pts. I will know if and when he does

4/30/23, 5:56 PM - +234 810 006 7926: He has beaten a Grand Master twice( a Japanese American Nikaru Nakamura) and it's just a matter of time he eclipses the records
4/30/23, 6:52 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Even me I've beaten Grandmaster online. Rowland has beaten about 3 or 4 grandmasters

So beating a GM is very very far from becoming one

I don't even have rating. But it's unlikely to be more than 2000
4/30/23, 7:04 PM - +234 810 006 7926: When you beat the world's no 5 at a very young Age of 10, it is only a matter of time. 2 years ago he needed just a 100 points to GM status, today he has closed that gap and I have no doubt in my mind he will be Nigeria's first Grand Master in the game and become world's no 1.

Totally agree with Onuh, Victor, Chijoke's submission.

Until you have that believe you are the best and smartest specimen of Man God ever created, you cannot conquer the world.

You guys are undoubtedly smart and better than your peers in the world.

I have never believed the Asians or Americans are smarter than Nigerians. And when I say smart, it's more than just a high IQ, it's in addition, street smart, financial intelligence, social intelligence, emotional intelligence etc.
4/30/23, 7:07 PM - +234 817 950 7218: Good luck to him and other smart Nigerians

Young *Female* Presented with lower  abdominal pain of 3 days. No other symptoms reported.
Examination: NAD.

Re-assured and discharged. 



Re presented  2 weeks later with *testicular gangrene*.



Patient now filing a complaint and seeking compensation.


Your thoughts guys : 
1. Firstly the patient identified as a female (actually looked like a female = breast, hips looks etc and the records says female). So the doctor wouldn't have thought of them having testicles 

2. The patient never complained of pain down below and even on probing denied genital symptoms (re PV bleeding etc). 

3. Would you have asked for testicular pain in someone presenting with lower abdominal pain despite clearly this person "looks" female 

4. Can transgender patients be correctly identified on medical records so clinicians are alert. 



*The doctor in question is devastated*

I am writing this in tears, & i request only 1 seconds of your precious time to pray for my Son (JUDE) & Also help him financially please.
Jude (My Son), is a 4yrs old baby, & he has Congestive Heart Failure, it started when he was 1-3 years he had fever and shortened of breathe, he can't breathe and if he wants to breathe is always very fast as if he is going to give up. 
Jude  has been on drip and oxygen for the past 2 months now since on the 21st/08/2022, it has not be easy buying oxygen because, he can't breathe, and the doctor says that a corrective heart surgery would be done & it will cost #850,000 and to God and man, me and my husband doesn't have such money to pay for the surgery, he is on oxygen 24/7 for now because that is the only option left and we have been in the hospital for 2 months now.
We are at CRYSTAL SPECIALIST HOSPITAL (27B KUBWA ABUJA).
Please if you are reading this right now.
To help us please, the cost of oxygen in this hospital is #5,800 and #50,000 respectively, please even if it is a 24hrs oxygen, because my son is at the point of death without oxygen, we have spent all we had and worked for even to eat is a problem please. 
Jude is my only son after 8 years of marriage and it's hasn't been easy with me, I was mocked, kicked and restricted 
If God touches you and your heart to help my son  please donate anything to the MOTHER'S bank account below God bless you, you shall never lack, all what you wish for shall be granted amen:
🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭

5/13/23, 8:38 AM - +234 803 097 7516: colleagues let me hear your opinion
5/13/23, 8:40 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Here his profile: Thomas Stephen Szasz (/sɑːs/ SAHSS; Hungarian: Szász Tamás István [saːs]; 15 April 1920 – 8 September 2012) was a Hungarian-American academic and psychiatrist. He served for most of his career as professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.[4] A distinguished lifetime fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and a life member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, he was best known as a social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, as what he saw as the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as scientism. His books The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970) set out some of the arguments most associated with him.

Szasz argued throughout his career that mental illness is a metaphor for human problems in living, and that mental illnesses are not "illnesses" in the sense that physical illnesses are, and that except for a few identifiable brain diseases, there are "neither biological or chemical tests nor biopsy or necropsy findings for verifying DSM diagnoses."[5]

Szasz maintained throughout his career that he was not anti-psychiatry but rather that he opposed coercive psychiatry. He was a staunch opponent of civil commitment and involuntary psychiatric treatment, but he believed in and practiced psychiatry and psychotherapy between consenting adults.
5/13/23, 9:27 AM - +234 817 950 7218: He has a point. 

Psychiatry has a lot of room for manipulation

Same thing happens with sexuality.

Are homosexuals no longer mentally ill?


For me, the key is to look at what harm the "illness" constitutes to society and how effective treatment is

If it's not harmful and treatment is not impactful then just let them live their lives
5/13/23, 9:50 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Fantastic view
5/13/23, 10:41 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Having watched it I don't agree with the man

Mental illness is an illness simple

*Health*, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".


What the Prof is just doing here is simple semantics since he is an authority in the field.... he wants to appeal to a particular group of people to simply make them feel better about themselves 


Truth is brutal and unpalatable. Mental illness is not a state of well being. The individual is simply not healthy.

Like Chino asked is homosexuality no longer an illness?

It used to be, but now we are told it is not.

How about transgender? They are telling us it is not an illness now

You wake up slash your penis or breast and say you are no longer a man or woman....and you should be looked upon as being okay?

You are no longer comfortable with your body and you say you are okay and it's not an illness 


Same psychiatrist will readily classify an Anorexia Nervosa patient as not being  okay because the individual is not comfortable with his/her body and is excessively thin....but same psychiatrist will say the one slashing his or her genitals off is normal and is brave and bold 

Make it make sense abeg


Who is deceiving who?

Some of these psychiatrists sef should check themselves too.
5/13/23, 10:45 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Don't forget he was specific
5/13/23, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Child psychiatrist
5/13/23, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: His point is that behaviour shouldn't be an illness
5/13/23, 10:46 AM - +234 803 097 7516: In children
5/13/23, 10:47 AM - +234 803 097 7516: I agree with your view and yes it is convincing. But take a look at his specifics
5/13/23, 10:50 AM - +234 817 034 1232: So ADHD is not an illness?

It should be normalised

He just wants to make parents feel better because it can be distressing 

Truth is eh if one doesn't face reality he/she will not address the problem

What he is saying is similar to Fat/Obese people who like to be addressed as Plus size....there by not taking responsibility.

A child with a ADHD can we honestly say it is a state of well being? If it's not what do  you call it scientifically or realistically?
5/13/23, 10:53 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Do you know that depending on the spectrum most of us are ADHD
5/13/23, 10:54 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Taking it from Chino perspective of results
5/13/23, 10:54 AM - +234 803 097 7516: How many ADHD kids have been successfully managed
5/13/23, 10:54 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And reverted back to the so called normal
5/13/23, 10:55 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And what is normal
5/13/23, 10:55 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Me being like you? Or you been like me
5/13/23, 11:00 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Honestly I don't know

But if the figures of successful treatment are high it shows there was a problem ab initio 

If the figures are really low it still doesn't negate the fact there was no problem. 

Just because we are unable to treat most cancers doesn't mean it isn't there
5/13/23, 11:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Your last line is in conflict with Chino submission which suggested the flexibility of psychiatry compared to other specialty
5/13/23, 11:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: Cancer is typically a disease
5/13/23, 11:01 AM - +234 803 097 7516: And when evidence of mortality
5/13/23, 11:07 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Yes psychiatry is still novel to an extent and uncharted as such should be flexible 

And if the treatment is not impactful there isn't any point going on with the treatment
5/13/23, 11:09 AM - +234 803 097 7516: There you go!

5/14/23, 7:59 AM - +234 817 034 1232: *Of Dino, Prayers and Governorship ambition* 

Mighty God in heaven. 

Your prophet in the wilderness has come to intercede on behalf of your prodigal Melaye. 

Since Dino became the PDP flag bearer, he has been running helter-skelter for prayers. 

Sometimes he runs to Imams, other times to Pastors. 

Oh Lord! He may have approached herbalists and babalawos too. 

We haven't seen such pictures yet. You know the societal stigma attached to it. 

Our creator in heaven. Please help Dino Melaye. 

For our people say whenever you see a bloated fat toad running in the daytime; either it chasing something or something is chasing it. 

Mighty Redeemer! 

Dino is chasing the governorship ticket but the white lion of Kogi and Ododo are chasing after him.


Our Father most high. We know you are tired of Dino. 

But you created him that way — a drama queen. 

Baba, the king of Kings. You told us the prayer of a sinner is an abomination unto you. 

We know normally Dino needs to be soaked and bathed with at least 20 litres of anointing oil to wash away his sins before he can face you: not to talk of even listening to him. 

Our Lord of host, this is an emergency situation 

Please listen to Dino. 

Father in heaven —  it is not every time you see a pot bellied political Pharisee rolling on the floor and raising his hands to praise you. 

You told us to pray without ceasing. Dino must have mistook it for seizures. 

Because every now and then he feigns generalised tonic seizures rolling on the floor and praying unto you without ceasing. 

At some point we are tempted to administer anti seizure medication. 

But this is Dino. He can be dramatic.


Oh God — you said when we confess our sins, you are faithful and just to forgive us. 

Please forgive Dino and hear him. 

Your prophet will stop here for now. 

You alone know what is good for the nice people of Kogi state. 

We shall await earnestly as you review the petition brought unto you.


Amen.

The appeal to authority fallacy is a type of informal fallacy that occurs when someone uses the authority, reputation, or expertise of a person or a source as the sole or primary reason to support their argument, without providing any other evidence or reasoning.

But then again, the point is even a person is actually smart, they do not necessarily know everything. 
A successful neurosurgeon might not know the first thing about managing a business.
A successful athlete might not necessarily be the best person to seek marital counseling from.

As you are medical specialist your views concerning politics, law, education, business e.t.c can give an overview.

I also didn't like the fact he was silent. He said he is father to all and thus must be mute, which I respect. 

I wish I could say same for some pastors who forgot their calling to endorse a drug baron

5/21/23, 4:53 AM - +234 817 034 1232: True

Let's even agree that APC has the right to oppose

But why is INEC also opposing live streaming?
What is there business with live streaming?

Obviously it's because they rigged.
5/21/23, 4:59 AM - +234 806 529 3872: Obviously, INEC has something to hide.
Interestingly, both LP and PDP agreed to live streaming, only INEC and APC opposed it!
The Guilty are afraid says James Hardly Chase.
5/21/23, 8:16 AM - +234 806 566 2895: It's shameful

5/21/23, 4:09 PM - +234 817 034 1232: *A Prayer for Dino and wild animals* 

Lord most high! It is Dino's matter again. 

He has started comparing himself with wild and lower animals. 

You created us in your image and proclaimed everything good and perfect. 

But Dino says he has the tail of a tiger and has warned Wike not to touch it.
Some have said he meant it figuratively — it was a metaphor. 

With Dino we can never to be sure what he means. 

Our Father in heaven, Dino once said he dangles like the scrotum of a ram: he dangles and dangles but never falls. 

Jehovah you can see where we are going with Dino's matter. 

When a man abandons his scrotum and goes for that of a ram — it is not far-fetched to say there is a problem. 

Recently Dino called himself the one true lion of Kogi state. 

Maker of heaven and earth, this is a dangerous statement. 

We know there is only one true lion of Kogi state: the hyperpigmented white lion residing at Lord Lugard House — Yahaya Bello. 

Two lions cannot be roaming around the confluence state; as two captains cannot steer a ship. 

Wike has now called Dino an attack dog. 

King of Kings, we are not saying that Dino is afflicted with rabies: but we know most attack dogs are usually rabid. 

Our redeemer please save Dino. 

It is possible because others have labelled Nigeria a zoo or jungle: that is why a senator wants to associate with wild animals. 

Our Father in heaven we know you blessed Dino with so many skills. 

He once jumped ontop of a tree with the finesse of a monkey, and the dexterity of a chimpanzee to avoid assassins not too long ago.
He was nicknamed the tree climbing senator.


Mighty God in heaven, Dino has been under stress recently. The gubernatorial race is not for the faint hearted. 

Let your will be done for Dino's election plans.

5/22/23, 5:35 AM - +234 817 034 1232: The way she still justified and tried to explain away that disabled people should not be in the presence of God is horrific and mind boggling. 

And she said it with a straight face.

I don't blame her sha....no be  her fault.
5/22/23, 5:36 AM - +234 817 034 1232: And if a woman wants abortion she should go ahead with it.

At least if not for anything...for her mental health.
5/22/23, 5:39 AM - +234 817 950 7218: The above clip has been received with thanks. I watched it with difficulty because she was blowing plenty grammar on a subject matter that I have very little interest in

She is quite attractive though. At least that was some compensation

In response to your question, I don't know if I have gripes about the Bible because I don't know what gripe means

However, since you used "still" , I can testify that I still feel the same way I felt the last time I mentioned religion.

So if it's gripes then I probably have gripes


I'll Google it right away sha

5/27/23, 7:56 AM - +234 803 692 8469: The ownership structure of Nigeria Air consists of Ethiopian Airlines as a majority shareholder with a 49% stake, while Nigerian entrepreneurs and companies, namely MRS, SAHCO and the Nigerian Sovereign Fund hold a 46% stake. The remaining 5% stake is held by the Nigerian Federal government.
5/27/23, 8:00 AM - +234 703 714 8734: So basically the FG only owns the name - Nigeria Air
5/27/23, 8:04 AM - +234 803 692 8469: Successful businesses are not run by government. Go ask developed countries.
5/27/23, 8:07 AM - +234 806 537 0692: Blessed Birthday Gladys

5/27/23, 8:08 AM - +234 803 692 8469: I really don’t know why some of you are laughing.
Seek for knowledge and pray for a better Nigeria.
5/27/23, 8:08 AM - +234 803 692 8469: British Airways is owned by International Airlines Group.

IAG is a multinational airline holding company that is headquartered in London, United Kingdom.
5/27/23, 8:09 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Good move, but why did they go to Ethiopian airlines when ibom Air could have given them a better deal? Shouldn't we first develop the indeginous?
5/27/23, 8:14 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Serious point…the IAG is headquartered in the Uk, so no funds are repatriated outside Uk. With majority ownership by a foreign company, large portions of profits would be repatriated to Ethiopia in dollars. This goes against the entire concept of national carriage, which is how countries balance fund repatriation from their economy due to the aviation industry
5/27/23, 8:17 AM - +234 803 281 3842: The new concept satisfies the aesthetics but not the economics. That’s why local aviation operators are suing the ministry of aviation. They didn’t look out for the interests of local aviation operators and it’s a big shame. Until we build local content, our Economy wouldn’t be stable
5/27/23, 8:18 AM - +234 806 792 1931: To play the devil's advocate, which group owns the Ethiopian airlines?
5/27/23, 8:22 AM - +234 703 714 8734: Very reason why ibom Air would have been a better deal, creating jobs for Nigerians
5/27/23, 8:23 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Our leadership has not been liberated from the colonial mindset. Rather than build the locals, we pride ourselves that this product is foreign. But, it’s hard to blame them- if they had collaborated with peace air, some would kick against it cos he is Igbo and if with Reno air, we for say Hausa have done it again. Ibom air is the least experienced operator, so it doesn’t make much sense either.
5/27/23, 8:24 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Let's say this is even true. 

Which reasonable country will allow its national strategic asset like an airline to be owned by another foreign nation? 

Only similar cursed countries like Nigeria. 

So Ethiopian a small country, with a smaller GDP has 49% stake and Nigeria the useless giant of Africa with the largest GDP has 5% 

And we are defending this anomaly? By talking about how Ethiopia has 49% Nigeria 5% and private investors have 46% 

May the gods help us
5/27/23, 8:24 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Good question 👌🏼

Let's see maybe they have lower stake like 5% like Nigeria
5/27/23, 8:28 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Exactly 


In addition 


Nigeria will never run a successful airline 

CBN is owing the IATA members over $750 Million dollars unremitted funds. 

No lessor in this case(Ethiopian airlines) will loan Nigeria fleet of Aircrafts based on this reality to start with.
5/27/23, 8:29 AM - +234 803 281 3842: Well, to be fair, this is not the first national carrier we have had. The others were majority federal government owned and were bankrupted by government. It’s a fact, federal government cannot run a business…the chop, i chop mindset we have means that once a new minister of aviation comes in, the whole thing collapses.
So, I am all for government staying out of running any business but we must use local business owners to run these stuff. Keep the money in our economy-that’s the only way our economy can grow
5/27/23, 8:30 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Why are they suing sef

Can APC run a successful airline 🤣🤣

It will die a natural death 

Nigeria don't export anything reasonable and they have a poor credit score

5/27/23, 2:10 PM - +234 803 281 3842: See the video o
5/27/23, 2:15 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: This isn't merely about "participation". It is about an active role. The video describes a situation where doctors prescribe death as a treatment, a concept that flips our understanding of medicine on its head. We universally acknowledge the detrimental impact of suicide, don't we? Isn't that why physicians treat depression and various other mental health disorders? This current development represents a complete inversion of the medical field.

In essence, doctors are doing the exact opposite of what our profession was intended for. To your point about drug-related deaths, this has been inadvertently happening for a significant period of time . However, euthanasia represents a more sinister and active iteration.

Euthanasia contradicts the fundamental tenet of the Hippocratic Oath which asserts "do no harm". It is an abomination and a direct affront to the sanctity of human life.

5/27/23, 9:28 PM - +234 817 950 7218: A terminally ill person should have the right to leave with dignity and on their own terms and chosen environment

Say goodbye to loved ones and go in peace without suffering

Unfortunately in Nigeria we prefer to consume the families resources and tilt those left behind into severe poverty while carrying out useless interventions for someone we know is dying
5/27/23, 9:31 PM - +234 817 950 7218: And then the person ends up enduring severe pain, confusion and loss of rationality, often losing sphincteric continence, develops bedsores and dies of septicemia or heart failure and literally chokes to death with someone pushing on their chest and administering silly injections that they know won't work

A very barbaric way we let go of our terminally ill patients

5/28/23, 1:06 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: You've touched upon a sensitive topic, stating that a terminally ill person should have the right to choose their end-of-life experience, which includes saying goodbye to loved ones, choosing their environment, and dying without suffering. I agree that these aspects are crucial for maintaining dignity at the end of life. I am also not ignorant of the Nigerian situation. It is always heart breaking to see  families exhaust resources on futile interventions for the dying, leading to severe poverty for those left behind.

However, while recognizing the right of the terminally ill to have a dignified departure, it's essential to remember that the dying are still part of the circle of life. Although they're transitioning into their final stage of life, they are still very much alive. As such, they deserve our respect and care, just like every living person. This is the reason behind concepts like hospice care, advance directives, and do-not-resuscitate orders.
Hospice care aims to make people feel as comfortable as possible when they're very sick. It helps reduce pain and provides emotional and spiritual support.

Advance directives and do-not-resuscitate orders are ways to ensure that the dying process isn't more painful than necessary. For example, it's okay to give a dying person strong medicine like morphine, even if it might hasten their death.

Euthanasia, however, involves intentionally causing death! There's a significant difference! It's one thing to let a sick person pass away naturally, but it's something else entirely to actively end their life, even if they've asked for it.

When we think about whether an act is right or wrong, we consider not just the outcome, but also the method and the intentions behind it. Accidental and intentional deaths are seen very differently, for example.

In the same way, there's a difference between stopping treatment to let a patient die naturally, and giving a patient a drug to cause their death. Both actions lead to the same outcome, but they're different because of the intentions and actions behind them.

Balancing the dignity and desires of the terminally ill with these ethical considerations is a delicate task. While it is essential to find ways to make the end-of-life process more humane and less draining on families, so they are not left in severe poverty after their loved one's passing; it is also very important to not loose sight of the fact that we are first and foremost called to PRESERVE life. Therein lies the challenge for societies and healthcare systems worldwide, including Nigeria.

Lastly, I would like to add, from my perspective, that God is the giver of life. I understand that not everyone may share my beliefs, but I find it necessary to voice this conviction nonetheless. Life is a gift from God, and only He possesses the authority to end it.
5/28/23, 3:34 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Very valid angle

Advanced directive, hospice care and DNR are very valid alternatives to allow people leave with some choice and dignity

Death can still sometimes come in a very hard and difficult way to handle

However, it's difficult to argue that overall euthanasia is superior to well handled hospice care

It's unfortunate that in Nigeria we have a long way to go in handling our terminally ill patients

5/28/23, 10:28 AM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Unfortunately, it sometimes feels like Nigeria is moving in the opposite direction, rather than making progress. This sentiment is especially apparent when considering our healthcare system, which often seems primitive compared to other nations. This is not just about advanced procedures like euthanasia; even fundamental aspects like patient examinations, bedside manners, pain management, and respect for patient autonomy are still largely lacking.

For instance, during my own battle with reproductive health issues, I visited some of the top OBGYNs in Jos. During these visits, the physical examination component was always extremely distressing for me. I required follicular tracking, a process that, without going into details, made me feel less than dignified, and in some ways, even violated. At the time, I rationalized that this was just the way it was done - that's how we were trained, after all. 

However, upon moving to the U.S., I was introduced to a whole new approach to healthcare. Here, even a simple act like administering aspirin is accompanied by a full explanation of what it is and it is done with the utmost courtesy. Physical examinations are conducted with utmost respect for the patient's comfort and dignity, ensuring proper draping and only exposing the necessary areas. 
Reflecting on my experiences in Nigeria, only one doctor demonstrated this level of attention to patient comfort.
5/28/23, 11:13 AM - +234 806 154 6225: Happy birthday dear Zilloĥ🥳🥳
5/28/23, 11:28 AM - +234 817 950 7218: Oh yes, we certainly have a very long way to go regarding how we treat and handle patient care.

Dignity, counseling etc

However even the western ways also have their own flaws

Because the only way you can ensure these things is by ensuring patients rights and protected and penalties executed

Then we have physicians constantly practicing in fear of litigation. Unnecessary interventions skyrocket. Unnecessary investigations also and then cost of healthcare then goes very high as well

In the end we humans always tend to make a mess of everything
5/28/23, 12:06 PM - +234 803 614 5338: Thank you dear Gladys! Happy birthday to you too. I wish you many happy returns
5/28/23, 12:27 PM - +1 (838) 202-8985: Yes, unfortunately so. I always joke that the default setting of humankind is “self destruct”. Our grim everyday realities seem to indicate that much.
Therefore while you may disagree, it’s the reason why we need a savior. God is the only restraint on our infinite capacity for evil (again I know we do not see eye-to-eye on this 😊).

This article touches on a subject that was alluded to in the video I shared, and that is the tendency for abuse.

I mean, I do not have to reiterate because the article says it all!

Why people choose death even in the midst of viable options for life, is something I still can’t comprehend. 

It’s the same argument I have against abortions. 

Why is “ending life” always the “go-to” choice?

5/29/23, 8:55 AM - +234 817 950 7218: We wish the new president all the best and hope he succeeds
5/29/23, 8:55 AM - +234 806 092 4290: We will only know when he begins to rule. Don't be surprised he ends being better than the rest. We can only hope and pray he does better. We can't afford anything worse than the last 8 years
5/29/23, 9:05 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Same wishful thinking we had for Buhari 

The statistics show Tinubu will be worse than Buhari.


Time will vindicate the prophet as usual 😀

Time is our ally

One dollar exchanges for close to 800....it will exchange for at least 2000; that is if Tinubu rules for at least 4 years


We are ushering the man who will wreck the economy
5/29/23, 9:06 AM - +234 817 034 1232: He will be worse

We will be here to analyse it again like Buhari


No amount of prayer will save a country with wicked supporters and evil leaders
5/29/23, 9:12 AM - +234 806 092 4290: The minimum requirements now is to pray for him and for the country. If he does well, we will all be happy, if he fails like his predecessors, we will all lament.
5/29/23, 9:13 AM - +234 806 092 4290: I don't trust him but I pray he leads us well.
5/29/23, 9:13 AM - +234 817 034 1232: Okay

We will communicate to the gods about this
5/29/23, 9:14 AM - +234 806 092 4290: Please do😊
