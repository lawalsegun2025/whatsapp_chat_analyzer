9/1/22, 09:00 - +234 906 002 1302: I'd suggest 30 mins before our regular time, so Segun and Faiza can have more time on the call before they have to sign off, that's 4pm Nigerian time
9/1/22, 09:02 - +254 713 230808: That's a good idea but Silindile might be in transit then that's why we made it 4:30pm WAT. 

Silindile, Faiza and Segun, what do you guys think?
9/1/22, 09:04 - Segun Lawal: yea that would have worked fine for me
9/1/22, 09:04 - Segun Lawal: but this is also ok
9/1/22, 09:35 - +27 72 434 6155: Yeah unfortunately, but I can  join you guys a bit late if it helps the others.
9/1/22, 11:15 - +234 803 791 6565: Didn‚Äôt go to work today so I can stay as long as the meeting takes
9/1/22, 11:42 - +254 713 230808: Thanks Segun, Silindile and Faiza. I think the most fair would be to do it at 4:30 pm WAT.
9/1/22, 11:49 - Segun Lawal: Alright
9/1/22, 12:07 - Segun Lawal: Hello @254713230808 please can you create a Google meeting, since we don not have our regular meeting today

9/3/22, 17:03 - +234 803 050 5798: @233276777380, please could you outline your four reasons for choosing Naive Bayes classifier over others?
9/3/22, 17:04 - +233 27 677 7380: we worked on diffrent models such as -- but we decided to go with naive byeres Based on the Bayes theorem, the Naive Bayes Classifier gives the conditional probability of an event A given event B.

and we decided to go with this model because of  
1.
It is simple and easy to implement.
2.
It is highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points.
3.
It is fast and can be used to make real-time predictions.
4 (draw attention to the graph)

With the help of a Naive Bayes classifier, Google News recognizes whether the news is political, world news, and so on.
9/3/22, 17:05 - +234 803 050 5798: thank you
9/3/22, 19:08 - +234 803 050 5798: @27724346155, could you share your executive summary speech here? Doesn't have to be exact, just share the points you wanna buttress
9/3/22, 19:19 - +27 72 434 6155: 1. Business motivation/mission: Pattern recognition and  Shortening Analysis Processes.
2. Customer motivation: To save time for our customers and help them change from single to bulk processing. 

3. Goal: create a NLP classifier via pre-processing, visualization and identifying the best model....Naive Bayes.

Sorry for the sickness and I wish you a quick recovery.

I did see your message and told the team during yesterday's meeting that you were sick and  I would therefore take over your section. I thought I had replied on Discord but turns out I clicked Shift+Enter (Notebook habits) and so the message was not sent. So sorry for that.
9/4/22, 13:05 - +254 100572102: Sorry Faiza, Get well  soon. Don't worry, We got you covered!

9/5/22, 11:44 - Segun Lawal: Alright
9/5/22, 11:45 - Segun Lawal: the model slide heading is written as "Model" instead of "MODEL" so that it can be consistent with the other headings

9/6/22, 15:10 - +234 906 002 1302: Did they say reshuffle?
9/6/22, 15:11 - +234 906 002 1302: Finally, I can close all these tabs
9/6/22, 15:13 - +254 100572102: I don't know why they can't talk about the "Elephant in the room", the next big thing... Seems they have no idea what to do next or what now that this project is typically done
9/6/22, 15:14 - +254 100572102: Seems like a trial and error where you reshuffle and wait for an output
9/6/22, 15:14 - +254 100572102: ??
9/6/22, 15:29 - Segun Lawal: Yea they don't
9/6/22, 15:29 - Segun Lawal: We are an experimental interns
9/6/22, 15:30 - +254 100572102: We're the Guinea pigs
9/6/22, 15:30 - Segun Lawal: Pretty much

9/7/22, 10:47 - +254 713 230808: Yaaaaasss! No reshuffle

9/7/22, 10:49 - Segun Lawal: Yeah
9/7/22, 10:52 - +254 713 230808: So this weeks ToDo:
1. Research on AllenNLP
2. Research on similar app that used AllenNLP
3. Investigate on how we'd like the data structures and formatting to look like.
4. If you're up for it, get some ideas up on Miro on which company we should look into. Include example data sources. Must be a company that cuts across Africa.
5. Look into Kedro tutorials
9/7/22, 10:53 - +254 713 230808: We will be giving a report on Friday.
9/7/22, 10:53 - +254 713 230808: Kindly put me down for AllenNLP
9/7/22, 10:53 - Segun Lawal: Kedro tutorial is for everyone
9/7/22, 10:54 - +254 713 230808: Yes, top 3 are for team as per Miro. last two individual.
9/7/22, 10:54 - Segun Lawal: Ok great
9/7/22, 10:55 - Segun Lawal: When are we meeting for discussions before we give a report on Friday
9/7/22, 10:56 - +254 713 230808: I feel we should up our game to daily meetings so that everyone can be on toes plus we can make it shorter if do it more frequently #MyTwoCents
9/7/22, 10:56 - Segun Lawal: Alright so the team have to agree on that
9/7/22, 10:57 - +254 713 230808: Maybe 30 mins max then break off to groups if necessary to go deep on a certain feature/assignment
9/7/22, 10:58 - Segun Lawal: Cool
9/7/22, 10:58 - +254 713 230808: What will we do about Robin? He is not on WhatsApp... should we be worried about him or we just move and wait for him to look for us?
9/7/22, 10:58 - Segun Lawal: I think we should let the internship supervisors know about him. Cos it's obvious he will not be involved in this project
9/7/22, 11:01 - +254 713 230808: In that case, let's just move. I am pretty sure the form feedback spoke for itself.
9/7/22, 11:08 - Segun Lawal: Ok great
9/7/22, 11:08 - Segun Lawal: So when are we meeting
9/7/22, 11:21 - +234 803 791 6565: I‚Äôd take number 2
9/7/22, 11:22 - +234 803 791 6565: Yes please that way segun and I would be able to attend the meetings fully, I propose we stick to 5:30-6:00  SAST
9/7/22, 11:34 - Segun Lawal: I agree to this
9/7/22, 11:35 - Segun Lawal: Nit staying to the end of meeting was a bit frustrating for me
9/7/22, 11:36 - +234 803 791 6565: Ikr
9/7/22, 16:16 - +234 803 791 6565: Hey guys are we meeting today?
9/8/22, 06:10 - +254 713 230808: Hey guys. Looks like there are no objections to daily 30-mins meetings so Segun, kindly create a calendar invite. 

Let's meet today, usual time, to discuss AllenNLP and similar apps that used it. 

We will be reporting our findings tomorrow so kindly pick a topic for Olamide to add you on Trello, come prepared, and be on time. 

Good day!
9/8/22, 08:15 - Segun Lawal: Alright

9/8/22, 08:21 - +234 906 002 1302: I was referring to this
9/8/22, 08:21 - +27 72 434 6155: No, it's still the same time, we're just committing to not making meetings longer than 30min so that Segun and Faiza can stay for the full duration of the meeting.

9/8/22, 12:57 - +254 713 230808: Hi guys.

Here's what I have on AllenNLP so far. The article I used is linked on the last slide. 

https://www.canva.com/design/DAFLoNTCC9g/wCH8GH1QkWhtOMJzEmXGCg/edit
9/8/22, 12:58 - +254 713 230808: I am now looking into how to use it for summarization and comprehension. If anyone has any leads I'd appreciate.
9/8/22, 13:00 - +234 906 002 1302: Nicely done birthday girlüôåüèΩ

9/8/22, 17:06 - Segun Lawal: Hello Team Sorry I couldn't present because of time, but I saw a link that contains several AllenNLP pretrained models, I am still going through to make sense of everthing
9/8/22, 17:06 - Segun Lawal: https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/
9/8/22, 17:14 - +254 713 230808: So sorry. I'm only seeing this now. I'll try and be recording daily just in case.
9/8/22, 17:14 - +254 713 230808: Thanks for the links guys, I'll look into all of them.
9/9/22, 06:58 - +254 713 230808: Good morning guys.

Please ensure you fill the form (linked below) posted by TK on *announcements* so you can get added to the relevant GitHub repo.

https://forms.gle/7KvZWE8daqJGyDN9A
9/9/22, 08:35 - +254 713 230808: Hi Silindile. I have spent the better part of the morning trying to understand this model but it's a bit challenging since there is not much material on it. From my findings, it is mostly mentioned on publications and I can't pinpoint any particular Python library/package for it. It seems to be heavily C++ plus what they have on GitHub has no mention of text or summarization.

My conclusion is, this is a proposed algorithm that is either in the makes for them to expand the Pinnochio library or they haven't even started work on it. 

Kindly let me know in case you have any information that would shade light to the contrary of my findings.
9/9/22, 08:55 - +27 72 434 6155: I also think it's a work in progress since the paper was recently published. We could just mention it as such...
9/9/22, 08:57 - +254 713 230808: I honestly don't see the need to mention something that hasn't been actualized. As I mentioned yesterday, there are several such papers out there. These proposed algorithms may never see the light of day for all we know.
9/9/22, 08:58 - +27 72 434 6155: Okay cool üëçüèæ
9/9/22, 09:02 - +233 27 677 7380: wow the way you two are talking about this thing üòäüëç

9/9/22, 09:11 - +254 713 230808: Or maybe create a video and share so we don't eat into meeting time.
9/9/22, 09:11 - +254 713 230808: We also need to learn Docker... is anyone familiar?
9/9/22, 09:18 - +234 803 791 6565: I do
9/9/22, 10:03 - +234 810 136 1613: Good idea

9/9/22, 17:53 - +234 906 002 1302: Sorry I missed the call today, I was so absorbed in some reading I didn't even realize
9/9/22, 18:48 - +27 72 434 6155: It's cool, it was a very short meeting, there was nothing much to discuss.
9/9/22, 18:58 - +233 27 677 7380: Oh ok
9/9/22, 18:58 - +233 27 677 7380: Was in town

9/12/22, 08:18 - +234 906 002 1302: Good morning everyone, hope you had a swell weekend. I hope we have all have been able clone the repo and set up our environment on VsCode, if you are having any problems, you can reach out to me
9/12/22, 08:29 - +234 803 791 6565: Hi good morning, I‚Äôm stuck at the kedai docker build command, it keeps returning an error message
9/12/22, 08:30 - +234 803 791 6565: *kedro
9/12/22, 08:38 - +234 906 002 1302: What error is it returning?
9/12/22, 08:50 - +27 72 434 6155: I couldn't install docker.

9/12/22, 08:52 - +27 72 434 6155: For the whole weekend...
9/12/22, 08:57 - +234 803 791 6565: Run apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-idk-headless && rm -rf
9/12/22, 09:01 - +234 906 002 1302: Have you installed docker successfully? Try opening the on its own see what error it gives, also you might want to update your VsCode if it's an older version
9/12/22, 09:01 - +234 906 002 1302: Did you use the link from the GitHub wiki page?
9/12/22, 09:02 - +27 72 434 6155: Nope, let me try using that.
9/12/22, 09:02 - +234 906 002 1302: Switch to the wiki tab, you will see a Docker link
9/12/22, 09:08 - +234 803 791 6565: Yes I have installed docker, it seems fine, okay let me check and update the VsCode
9/12/22, 09:10 - +234 906 002 1302: At the bottom right of your VScode window you will see a bell icon click it to check for updates
9/12/22, 09:13 - +234 803 791 6565: No new notifications
9/12/22, 09:14 - +234 906 002 1302: Ok try opening your docker desktop, does it give an error prompt?
9/12/22, 09:23 - +234 803 791 6565: No it doesn‚Äôt
9/12/22, 09:30 - +254 713 230808: Hey. Meeting is on.
9/12/22, 09:34 - +234 803 050 5798: Hi, could you share the link, I can't seem to find it on my calendar

9/12/22, 09:35 - +234 803 050 5798: gracias!
9/12/22, 09:37 - +233 27 677 7380: @254713230808 WE NEED YOU
9/12/22, 09:38 - +234 803 050 5798: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFLoNTCC9g/wCH8GH1QkWhtOMJzEmXGCg/edit

9/12/22, 09:38 - +254 713 230808: Had to restart router.
9/12/22, 09:38 - +254 713 230808: Rejoining.
9/12/22, 09:41 - +254 713 230808: My internet is the worst today. So so sorry guys.
9/12/22, 09:47 - +233 27 677 7380: If u have other devices connected to it disconnect them
9/12/22, 12:34 - +234 803 050 5798: Hello team,
I think we should have a session together for the environment setup so that we could solve pending issues hampering our installations. 

Those who have completed theirs would help others who haven‚Äôt.
9/12/22, 12:34 - +234 803 050 5798: I suggest after our meeting today, we could stay back for that. What do you guys think?
9/12/22, 12:36 - +234 803 791 6565: Segun and I would be in transit then
9/12/22, 12:37 - +234 906 002 1302: An earlier time would be more appropriate I think
9/12/22, 12:38 - +27 72 434 6155: Guys, do we have to go through that long process to login to our virtual desktop / AWS instance?
9/12/22, 12:40 - +234 906 002 1302: If you are using the VSCode within the instance you will have to set up the whole environment from scratch also, you may need github desktop on that machine, so you can connect to the repo
9/12/22, 12:40 - +234 803 050 5798: Okay, could you suggest a time outside 2pm - 3pm SAST?
9/12/22, 12:41 - +234 906 002 1302: Our call is actually for 3-4pm SAST @2348030505798
9/12/22, 12:41 - +234 803 050 5798: Sorry, 3-4
9/12/22, 12:41 - +234 803 050 5798: Yeah. Thanks
9/12/22, 12:42 - +234 906 002 1302: Lets do 2-3
9/12/22, 12:42 - +234 906 002 1302: SAST
9/12/22, 12:42 - +234 906 002 1302: Thats about 18 mins from now, if others are okay with it
9/12/22, 12:45 - +234 803 050 5798: Unfortunately, yes. 
Especially cos you have to restart the EC2 instance anytime you want to use it, so the IP address would always change, hence you‚Äôd go through the login process from scratch. 

The sacrifice for escaping the heavy AWS Billings. üôÇ

9/13/22, 17:23 - +233 27 677 7380: <Media omitted>
9/14/22, 05:56 - Segun Lawal: Type of dataset we need:-
The data set will be a csv file
For Articles the columns we will be needing includes;
‚Ä¢	Headings
‚Ä¢	Text
‚Ä¢	Date
‚Ä¢	Author
‚Ä¢	Channel/Source and
‚Ä¢	Category e.g Technology, Finance, Economics, Science etc
For tweeter the columns we will be needing includes:
‚Ä¢	Text
‚Ä¢	Date
‚Ä¢	Handle
But our conclusion at the end of the meeting yesterday regarding the columns we need for the data set is this; The Data Engineers should get as much columns as possible because we would nit know if we may find some insights from any of the columns. 
It is better to more columns that to have less and be restricted
9/14/22, 06:45 - +234 803 050 5798: Thanks @2348036473475 üôåüèΩ
9/14/22, 07:25 - +234 810 136 1613: Morning Silas,

9/14/22, 09:53 - Segun Lawal: Yea he said that right from the last project
9/14/22, 09:53 - Segun Lawal: Well I will suggest he can be getting updates from anyone in the group. That's if he is interested
9/14/22, 09:55 - +254 713 230808: OK. Whoever is willing to be updating him can contact him because he has asked me how he can be accessing those messages.
9/14/22, 09:56 - Segun Lawal: Ok great, just tell him to reach out to anyone on discord
9/14/22, 09:56 - +254 100572102: Which channel does he for communication
9/14/22, 09:56 - Segun Lawal: I hope he is on discord
9/14/22, 09:57 - +254 713 230808: With the team? Discord.
9/14/22, 09:58 - +254 713 230808: Should I tell him to contact you? Because I'm personally not willing to do which makes me assume there are those amongst us who have the same opinion.
9/14/22, 09:58 - +254 713 230808: I need willing seller lol
9/14/22, 10:00 - Segun Lawal: ok just tell him to contact anyone in the team as you have a lot on your hand

9/14/22, 10:24 - +233 27 677 7380: i think we should use yours for the code review cos it incorporate what i did
9/14/22, 10:25 - +254 713 230808: I am having some trouble. I tried to run Olamides notebook and now I'm getting import errors on my own notebook, I think it was the pip install.
9/14/22, 10:25 - +254 713 230808: But I'll present the version that I sent on Discord.
9/14/22, 10:26 - +233 27 677 7380: yea upgrade your transformers
9/14/22, 10:26 - +233 27 677 7380: and it would work
9/14/22, 10:28 - +254 713 230808: I just fixed it. I was trying to upgrade transformers and it didn't work. Did uninstall and everything. Now I have upgraded tokenizers and it worked. 

Thanks!!!
9/14/22, 16:54 - +234 803 050 5798: @254713230808, could you tell me what exactly you need? I just wanna be sure, my background was so noisy.

9/14/22, 17:22 - +254 713 230808: Yes! That would be even better.

9/14/22, 17:27 - +233 27 677 7380: I mean the team meetings we normally do at 3:00gmt
9/14/22, 17:28 - +254 713 230808: Ah. OK. Not much was said as we did most of the stuff during code review and no one had anything to present. So we are basically just working on the suggestions made during code review. It was a very short meeting.
9/14/22, 17:30 - +233 27 677 7380: Ok
9/15/22, 08:17 - +27 72 434 6155: Good morning guys, my area will be experiencing power load shedding between 10:00 to 12:00, we normally get network interruptions when there's no power. I might not be able to join our stand up meeting.
9/15/22, 08:51 - +234 803 050 5798: @254713230808

9/15/22, 09:07 - +254 713 230808: Guys, there is a blackout here. Hopefully electricity will be back in time for the standup but if not, kindly excuse me from the mentors
9/15/22, 09:11 - +234 803 050 5798: Some of us Nigerians are finding it difficult to understand how a blackout could be such a serious challenge üòÇ
9/15/22, 09:15 - +254 713 230808: lol.I thought Nigeria was worse? 

Personally it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not home. We have solar and this is quite foreign for me. I don‚Äôt even know what to do with myself atm lol
9/15/22, 09:16 - +254 713 230808: I only have mobile data for WhatsApp lol

9/15/22, 16:44 - +233 27 677 7380: @2349060021302 we could hear u
9/15/22, 17:06 - +234 803 050 5798: Here‚Äôs the CSV dataset
9/15/22, 19:20 - +254 713 230808: Hey guys. My electricity just came back about an hour ago. 

What was discussed in today's team meeting kindly?
9/15/22, 19:25 - +27 72 434 6155: Hi Lista, I'll send you a VN.
9/15/22, 19:27 - +254 713 230808: Hi Silindile. Thanks!
9/15/22, 21:49 - +233 27 677 7380: i just noticed something
9/15/22, 21:51 - +233 27 677 7380: the T5 summarizer doesn't just pic sentences from the passage and show to you. it actually summarizes the passage rewriting the whole thing in it own words but based on the passage fed to it
9/15/22, 21:52 - +233 27 677 7380: it like it has already combined extractive and abstractive summaries
9/15/22, 22:05 - +234 810 136 1613: Well, I don‚Äôt think so because,

Abstractive summarization is supposed to generate words, that‚Äôs what abstract means I.e to rewrite the entire document
9/15/22, 22:05 - +234 803 791 6565: Ermm I noticed that it only summarizes the first part of whatever article is fed to it and ignores the rest though
9/15/22, 22:08 - +234 810 136 1613: While Extractive bring out and group the most important parts of the text together
9/15/22, 22:08 - +233 27 677 7380: it has a  limit to the number of words it can summarize
9/15/22, 22:09 - +233 27 677 7380: <Media omitted>
9/15/22, 22:13 - +234 803 791 6565: Which is why performing the extractive summary first before the abstractive would give you a more accurate result
9/15/22, 22:14 - +234 803 791 6565: Okayy but we‚Äôll revisit this tomorrow I‚Äôm sleepy rn
9/16/22, 07:35 - +254 713 230808: Good morning guys! @233276777380 I saw your work on GitHub and it was very inspirational. I am stress testing the models with the help of your code to see how long articles (a combination of 27 articles/rows provided by @2348030505798) will affect them. So far *transformer-qa* is the only one returning results lol. Investigating why the other two are not behaving. I will create a branch on GitHub and push my code soon.
9/16/22, 07:36 - +254 713 230808: In the meantime..... 

On Wednesday, TK and Luka asked us to put up our plans going forwards on Miro so as to present them to Jaco. I have added the relevant section for this. Kindly fill in the *Text Summarization* (Olamide, Faiza, and/or Silas) and *Web scraping* (Byron, Daniel, and/or Yussuf) before the meeting with Jaco. And Silas, feel free to modify what I have put up on the *QA* section. 

https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPZygEa8=/
9/16/22, 07:59 - +254 713 230808: Some good news, all models have processed a 23-page long passage (length based on Word document) although *bidaf-elmo-model* is acting crazy with the first question. Let's see how it will perform with the second one.
9/16/22, 08:40 - +233 27 677 7380: Hello Please i have sent out invitations to everyone to be a collaborator on the GitHub page so please if u have worked on something create a branch and drop it there before the meeting
9/16/22, 08:41 - +233 27 677 7380: Can you please drop this notebook in your branch so i have look at it
9/16/22, 08:41 - +234 906 002 1302: Good morning, I have been liasing with Byron on the notebook, so might not need to have a branch
9/16/22, 08:42 - +233 27 677 7380: i have also worked on something in my branch
9/16/22, 08:42 - +233 27 677 7380: i utilized the csv @2349060021302 and byron produced
9/16/22, 08:43 - +234 906 002 1302: How did it work? Need anything changed?
9/16/22, 08:43 - +233 27 677 7380: if u check my branch the name of the file is called TeamA_experiment
9/16/22, 08:43 - +233 27 677 7380: nope it was very good
9/16/22, 08:44 - +234 906 002 1302: Awesome, now we can get articles relating to shell, cos the one we gave you was random articles
9/16/22, 08:49 - +254 713 230808: Done.
9/16/22, 08:56 - +233 27 677 7380: <Media omitted>
9/16/22, 08:59 - +233 27 677 7380: all this i was able to do based on @2348037916565 research
9/16/22, 09:01 - +254 713 230808: We can hear you Silas lol
9/16/22, 09:01 - +234 803 791 6565: Nicely done!
9/16/22, 09:02 - +234 803 791 6565: So how are we going to do the presentation
9/16/22, 09:02 - +254 713 230808: Try rejoining if you still cant hear anything.
9/16/22, 09:02 - +234 803 791 6565: Do I present the notebook I have and explain my findings then Silas takes over or?
9/16/22, 09:03 - +254 713 230808: 30 mins 3 teams.
9/16/22, 09:03 - +27 72 434 6155: Did Silas not say he'll incorporate everything in one notebook?
9/16/22, 09:04 - +27 72 434 6155: To avoid multiple notebooks..
9/16/22, 09:04 - +233 27 677 7380: i have done that
9/16/22, 09:04 - +254 713 230808: I'll give a brief overview of where we are at with QA by answering the question on Miro.
9/16/22, 09:05 - +234 803 791 6565: On your branch? Or on the main branch?
9/16/22, 09:05 - +254 713 230808: Then Silas can also present on his notebook since he combined everything
9/16/22, 09:05 - +254 713 230808: Silas can start.
9/16/22, 09:05 - +254 713 230808: What do you guys think?
9/16/22, 09:05 - +234 803 791 6565: Great idea
9/16/22, 09:05 - +27 72 434 6155: I'm happy with that, since we only have 5 minutes
9/16/22, 09:06 - +254 713 230808: Cool. So @233276777380  you will start then give me a min or two to summarize what I did for QnA
9/16/22, 09:10 - +254 713 230808: Kindly confirm Silas
9/16/22, 09:11 - +234 803 050 5798: twas filtered for shell though
9/16/22, 09:12 - +234 906 002 1302: The 27 articles?
9/16/22, 09:12 - +234 906 002 1302: Which channel did you get that from?
9/16/22, 09:14 - +234 803 050 5798: yeah
9/16/22, 09:15 - +234 803 050 5798: twas a rough cleaning with the 'shell' keyword
9/16/22, 09:15 - +234 803 050 5798: <Media omitted>
9/16/22, 09:15 - +233 27 677 7380: yes
9/16/22, 09:19 - +234 906 002 1302: That's what I originally suggested but remember what TK said about that? Some relevant articles may not not have shell as keyword
9/16/22, 09:22 - +234 803 050 5798: There's no way an article talking about Shell won't have the 'shell' word in it. Even Shell company's publication has the word littered about.

That's why the filtering was done for any of the columns in the dataset to mitigate the risk
9/16/22, 09:30 - +234 906 002 1302: Oh sorry, you meant the whole text, I thought you filtered with 'keyword' column
9/16/22, 09:34 - +234 803 050 5798: yup, the whole data. From the title, body, down to the keyword
9/16/22, 09:34 - +234 906 002 1302: Ohh, that could work
9/16/22, 09:35 - +234 906 002 1302: But we have 1197 links, what further filtering did you do till 27
9/16/22, 09:37 - +234 803 050 5798: that's not for the csv. I had already run another batch of articles before pushing the notebook
9/16/22, 09:39 - +234 906 002 1302: Can we have a call in an hour, I think I have a few things to add as well
9/16/22, 09:39 - +254 713 230808: Guys, what are we doing today?
9/16/22, 09:40 - +234 803 050 5798: okay
9/16/22, 09:40 - +233 27 677 7380: yea
9/16/22, 09:41 - +254 713 230808: For everyone or for DE?
9/16/22, 09:42 - +234 906 002 1302: I was actually talking about me and Byron, but y'all are welcome,
9/16/22, 09:42 - +234 803 050 5798: From the DE, we'd be working on how to scrape from multiple sources efficiently
9/16/22, 09:43 - +254 713 230808: OK. Cool. Post up the meeting link here in case others are interested.
9/16/22, 09:43 - +234 803 050 5798: so soon, we'd push a more robust dataset, say around 2k articles
9/16/22, 09:44 - +254 713 230808: Awesome!
9/16/22, 09:44 - +254 100572102: @2348030505798  @2349060021302 Should we disregard twitter as a data source and focus only on articles or what's the way forward?
9/16/22, 09:44 - +234 906 002 1302: Not just yet, let's discuss that on the call
9/16/22, 09:45 - +234 906 002 1302: I'll send an invite in a moment
9/16/22, 09:45 - +254 713 230808: @233276777380 I have asked the mentors if we should create a new column for each question asked. Do you have any thoughts on this?
9/16/22, 09:46 - +233 27 677 7380: Yea.
9/16/22, 09:50 - +254 713 230808: Guys TK asking us to jump on a call for quick session

9/16/22, 16:04 - +234 810 136 1613: Hello everyone

9/16/22, 17:33 - +234 803 050 5798: Gone through ü§ìüëç
9/16/22, 17:34 - +234 803 050 5798: It‚Äôs a symptom ü§£
No fear
9/16/22, 17:38 - +234 906 002 1302: <Media omitted>
9/18/22, 17:53 - +234 906 002 1302: Happy Sunday guys
9/18/22, 17:54 - +234 906 002 1302: I have an update from Luka, what we had spoken about on Friday
9/18/22, 17:54 - +234 906 002 1302: Hi Daniel, thank you for voicing your concerns. I think what Nthikeng was referring to was that we did not anticipate that some interns would take three to four days to get kedro and docker working (we purposefully set up docker so that we could start coding ASAP). This caused some unanticipated delays. It becomes even more difficult to manage project timeline when interns do not attend meetings and do not communicate with us, which is something I stressed in the announcements channel. 

But I will add that once github project is up and running, the tasks will be much more clearly defined with more strict deadlines. Right now, we are in the research and experimentation phase, opening the floor to ideas, so it is natural that we will work in different directions. This is why I always stress for individuals to work on Miro so that Tk and I can comment, but as you may see this isn't always happening.
9/18/22, 17:55 - +234 906 002 1302: I've taken note and we will shed more light on the situation in the coming week
9/18/22, 18:52 - Segun Lawal: Alright, great
9/18/22, 21:17 - +234 803 791 6565: Hi guys good evening, I‚Äôll be unavailable tomorrow morning as I‚Äôll be taking my AWS certification exam
9/18/22, 21:17 - +234 803 791 6565: Wish me luckü•π
9/18/22, 21:20 - +234 906 002 1302: You got this, CCP is easy, reach out if you need study materials
9/18/22, 21:25 - +234 803 050 5798: Good luck!
9/18/22, 21:46 - +234 803 791 6565: That‚Äôs comforting to hearüòÅ thank you üôè
9/18/22, 21:46 - +234 803 791 6565: Thank you üôè

9/19/22, 08:12 - +27 72 434 6155: All the best with your exam Faiza.
9/19/22, 08:16 - +27 72 434 6155: Good morning guys, once again I'm scheduled for loadshedding between 10:00 - 12:00 SAST,  which means I won't be able to attend both the meetings with our mentors today üò©. Ey things are very bad in South Africa these days in terms of power outages, it's actually the worst we've ever experienced!
9/19/22, 09:30 - +234 906 002 1302: Good morning guys
9/19/22, 09:30 - +234 906 002 1302: Please if you have not sent out an apology please join the call

9/20/22, 11:44 - +234 803 050 5798: you were expecting NACLs and gateway configs? 
You're getting used to hardwork üòÇ
9/20/22, 11:55 - +234 906 002 1302: Its still looking hard sha,, for instance we dont know which port kedro will use, for the security config
9/20/22, 12:31 - +233 27 677 7380: @254713230808 the Ner hasn't been pushed into your branch
9/20/22, 12:35 - +234 803 050 5798: @2349060021302, I'm trying to rewrite the web scraping code to be 'kedro compliant'. Let's align later for the RDS setup.

@254100572102, pls let's meet prolly after our evening call to map the pipeline activity
9/20/22, 12:36 - +234 906 002 1302: Please let it be before the evening call
9/20/22, 12:37 - +234 906 002 1302: I may create a dummy instance before then
9/20/22, 12:37 - +234 803 050 5798: 3 PM WAT okay? @2349060021302 @254100572102

9/20/22, 16:22 - +233 27 677 7380: This message was deleted
9/20/22, 16:22 - +233 27 677 7380: This message was deleted
9/20/22, 16:31 - +254 713 230808: Join meeting https://meet.google.com/pes-mxpy-cmt?authuser=0
9/20/22, 16:34 - +254 100572102: Sorry team, I cannot join the call today
9/20/22, 20:19 - +234 803 050 5798: Completed the python script for pipeline @2349060021302 @254100572102 

and created team-a/data-engineering branch in the github repo

https://github.com/Nthiki/nlp-sdg/blob/team-a/data-engineering/notebooks/webscraping_shell.ipynb
9/20/22, 20:56 - +254 100572102: good work @2348030505798 next is to set-up a linux instance that will run our python and sql scripts efficiently to load onto our rds db. then we can automate after that
9/20/22, 20:57 - +254 100572102: How big is our data so far?
9/20/22, 20:58 - +234 803 050 5798: yeah
9/20/22, 21:00 - +234 803 050 5798: the data isn't big yet cos of the filtering to get what we need.

publications that focus solely on oil companies may be helpful compared to the regular news portals
9/20/22, 21:26 - +234 906 002 1302: Should I get more links? Also we can add the twitter data that @254100572102 scraped
9/20/22, 21:36 - +234 803 050 5798: we could try more links.
wouldn't the twitter data be a kinda duplication since another team's on it?
9/20/22, 21:37 - +234 803 050 5798: I could try to get shell's news too. they have more than 1k publications popping up, i didn't include it mainly because of the bias we're avoiding
9/20/22, 21:58 - +234 906 002 1302: Not exactly,
9/20/22, 21:58 - +234 906 002 1302: What about the time out?
9/20/22, 22:00 - +234 906 002 1302: I'll explain in detail on tomorrow's call
9/20/22, 22:00 - +234 803 050 5798: Not an issue
9/20/22, 22:00 - +234 803 050 5798: Okay
9/20/22, 22:40 - +233 27 677 7380: @254713230808 and @27724346155

I have been able to extract the locations and organizations into a new column
9/21/22, 06:00 - Segun Lawal: @2348037916565 and @2348101361613, I was able to tweak the summarization a bit and utilize a function written by Silas. So we have it in a function. We'll see what Luka and TK has to say about it, so that we can get it running on kedro
9/21/22, 06:41 - +234 803 791 6565: That‚Äôs amazing news, good morning, I won‚Äôt be able to make it to the code review as I‚Äôll be having a meeting at work around the same time, could we meet by the same time we did yesterday so you can take us through what you did and the feedback you‚Äôll be getting from them?
9/21/22, 06:42 - Segun Lawal: Alright! That will be fine
9/21/22, 07:26 - +254 713 230808: Good morning.

I‚Äôm having some challenges with my development environment.

Command prompt won‚Äôt open, Jupyter is lost, and VS Code won‚Äôt recognise allennlp. 

Oooooffffff! I feel like going back to bed.
9/21/22, 07:30 - +234 803 791 6565: Thank you
9/21/22, 07:30 - +234 803 791 6565: Oh my that‚Äôs sounds like a lot!
9/21/22, 07:51 - +233 27 677 7380: @2348036473475 are you the one who created the text summarization branch

9/23/22, 09:14 - +234 803 050 5798: Good morning team. Please accept my apologies too. @2348036473475, please could you edit the meeting details for our time slot instead of ‚Äúall day‚Äù?

Would prefer that so that notifications could help in reminding us. Thanks
9/23/22, 09:18 - +233 27 677 7380: yea
9/23/22, 09:21 - Segun Lawal: ok you don't want the evening meetings to be every day?
9/23/22, 09:25 - +234 803 050 5798: Not that. Just the time slot. 
‚ÄúAll day‚Äù means 24hrs 

You could edit the time slot for 4:30 WAT and make it repeat daily
9/23/22, 09:25 - Segun Lawal: that's exactly what I did
9/23/22, 09:26 - +234 803 050 5798: That‚Äôs strange. Mine just covers the entire day with no specific time
9/23/22, 09:26 - Segun Lawal: It also have calendar  notification
9/23/22, 09:29 - +234 810 136 1613: That's true, the invitation says all-day
9/23/22, 09:31 - +27 72 434 6155: Mine too, and no calendar notification.... I don't know how the settings changed because initially it was set up correctly and we used to get notifications....please check it out.
9/23/22, 09:33 - +234 803 050 5798: There could be a possibility that you created two of those and the one you have the notifications isn‚Äôt the one we are in. Just check to be sure anyways
9/23/22, 09:34 - Segun Lawal: ok
9/23/22, 09:47 - +234 803 050 5798: Gotten the new notification. It‚Äôs more like it although, this is for fridays alone.
9/23/22, 09:49 - Segun Lawal: check it, its for weekdays(monday to friday) starting from today up until 21st October

9/29/22, 08:27 - +27 72 434 6155: I'm also going to experience loadshedding from 10:00 - 12:00 SAST, but I was planning to drive to another area that's on a different power grid... Should we still have the dry run this morning then? If not, it's gonna save me some fuel üôà
9/29/22, 08:27 - +254 100572102: Sure, It's actually called Schengen Visa. It's the unified Visa for almost all European countries except UK

9/29/22, 08:37 - Segun Lawal: Big Congratulations to Yussuf and Silas. Really happy for you all

9/29/22, 09:01 - +254 713 230808: Amen!
9/29/22, 09:01 - +234 906 002 1302: If half of the team will be unavailable for the dry run this morning, then I think we can just cancel it
9/29/22, 09:01 - +254 713 230808: Good tingz come to those who wait, innit? Lol
9/29/22, 16:33 - +254 713 230808: Team meeting is on.

9/29/22, 18:29 - +234 906 002 1302: Hi @2348036473475 
What I was saying on the call concerning retrospective pain point was that, some of the features we needed were in AWS, but because we had very limited access, we always had to ask for everything and wait for responses. This slowed us down considerably
9/29/22, 18:29 - Segun Lawal: Alright got it
9/29/22, 18:30 - +27 72 434 6155: <Media omitted>
9/29/22, 18:31 - +27 72 434 6155: The screenshot has the questions...
9/29/22, 18:33 - +27 72 434 6155: @233276777380 please let me know if you are able to tackle the visualization for any of these questions so I won't add it on my section.
9/29/22, 18:33 - +233 27 677 7380: ok
9/29/22, 21:29 - +234 906 002 1302: https://www.loom.com/share/e1f33d665ec1425582b43d8fc0844413 

Hey guys, so I realized rather than having to upload to Youtube, I can just simply send a link to the video, Loom is awesome. Please let me know if there is any problem viewing. 
PS- There was a lot of 'errm' I am working on it
9/29/22, 21:55 - +233 27 677 7380: @254713230808 and @27724346155 
please check my repo team-a experiment scroll to 
Answering different questions from predefined options

and let me know if that solves the question and ans issue
9/29/22, 21:57 - +233 27 677 7380: you spoke for 8min i tot the limit is 5 min
9/29/22, 21:59 - +27 72 434 6155: Having very bad connectivity issues, I'll check again after midnight, I've given up at this point.
9/29/22, 22:00 - +27 72 434 6155: If it covers the visualization aspect, it should be fine.
9/29/22, 22:01 - +233 27 677 7380: Now coming to work on that
9/29/22, 22:01 - +233 27 677 7380: What exactly am i to visualize
9/29/22, 22:01 - +27 72 434 6155: Let me check on discord quickly.
9/29/22, 22:03 - +27 72 434 6155: <Media omitted>
9/29/22, 22:05 - +27 72 434 6155: Don't worry about it @233276777380, I'll just mention visualization as something we're currently working on.
9/29/22, 22:12 - +233 27 677 7380: Ok
9/29/22, 23:28 - +234 906 002 1302: Yes, I will cut it short an speak more briskly
9/29/22, 23:33 - +233 27 677 7380: Was that for the app demonstration
9/29/22, 23:48 - +234 906 002 1302: No, overview and work remaining
9/29/22, 23:48 - +234 906 002 1302: Byron is handling demonstration

Team Retrospective MOck Presentation
9/30/22, 05:35 - +254 713 230808: Good morning everyone. Apologies for the delay from my end. I took a nap after dinner and never woke up again lol. I was seriously exhausted.

Anyway, here is my recording:

https://www.loom.com/share/dfa924473cd347e5a64c8aaefb2d8138
9/30/22, 05:45 - +254 713 230808: Hey Daniel. If you are not the one taking the demo portion of advice you not show any code. The Moro board is enough to cover your two portions. I believe your 2 parts can be a total of 3 mins so Byron can have enough time to incorporate the code you showed.
9/30/22, 05:50 - +254 713 230808: Nice. It seems a bit long now but I trust you can adjust as needed with your ninja skills üòâ
9/30/22, 05:59 - +254 713 230808: The approach is awesome. However, my worry, and the reason why I wanted to use enr for gathering resources, technology etc, is that they reply is not something that can be graphed. QnA basically just gives you a bunch of text that doesn‚Äôt even mention a resource in most cases and I fear it would be same for technology.
9/30/22, 07:07 - +234 906 002 1302: I get that, but, there is a lot of code we have and his time may not be enough to show all
9/30/22, 07:12 - +254 713 230808: Check the requirements on Discord. They just want a sample, not everything. Plus if you talk less, he gets more time to cover his part.
9/30/22, 07:13 - +234 906 002 1302: What time is our meeting?
9/30/22, 07:19 - +233 27 677 7380: 7 gmt

9/30/22, 08:49 - +234 803 050 5798: I‚Äôd suggest that @233276777380 presents my notebook so that he could quickly switch to his session since his is after mine

9/30/22, 08:50 - +234 803 050 5798: If you‚Äôre okay with this, when opened, just scroll to the last code block in the notebook, I‚Äôd use that to explain the entire project
9/30/22, 08:51 - +27 72 434 6155: Okay
9/30/22, 08:51 - +254 713 230808: Thanks! Go in immediately after Segun

9/30/22, 09:27 - +234 803 050 5798: Yeah. That code block has the calls that‚Äôs linked to all the functions in the notebook. Hence no need going through the functions, just explain the calls
9/30/22, 09:28 - +254 713 230808: Ah ok. Looked weird though

10/17/22, 11:17 - Segun Lawal: Presendation Update:

There is a need for the DS part of the presentation aside from streamlit. This includes

- DS approach and tools used
- Why we chose pre-trained models over training our own model
- Why Kedro and Docker made life easier and why we used them both
- And the work we did on the data provided by the DE before we deployed the results on StreamLit

@2348030505798 Byron: Introduction and DE
@2348037916565 Faiza DS
10/17/22, 11:38 - +254 713 230808: For whitepaper, there is incosistency in use of tense. I have changed everything to past tense (we have already done the project) where there present continouse tense was being used.
10/17/22, 11:39 - +254 713 230808: * where present continouse tense was being used.
10/17/22, 11:39 - +254 713 230808: Actually, this is work in prrogress lol. I haven't finished yet.
10/17/22, 12:18 - +233 27 677 7380: Please can some one help me answer this question
What is the motive behind the app
10/17/22, 12:22 - Segun Lawal: The purpose of the Whole app features (Team B and C inclusive) according to Luka is to help Shell Oil Company keep track of their involvement with SDGs
10/17/22, 12:23 - +233 27 677 7380: what of team A
10/17/22, 12:23 - +233 27 677 7380: our app
10/17/22, 12:23 - Segun Lawal: Team A inclusive
10/17/22, 12:24 - +27 72 434 6155: I think ours focuses specifically on text comprehension of articles (via the three functions) associated with Shell
10/17/22, 12:24 - Segun Lawal: yea
10/17/22, 12:26 - Segun Lawal: Our app is to comprehend text related to Shell and to answer relevant questions regarding Shell involvement with SDGs
10/17/22, 12:27 - +233 27 677 7380: Thank you

10/18/22, 18:24 - +254 713 230808: Hey, volunteers üòä.

Please choose a folder from one of the five above and let the team know which one you've picked. Unzip then run all cells for both notebooks. Leave this to continue working overnight then send me the resulting csv files (organisation and location) tomorrow. 

Thanks in advance!
10/18/22, 18:25 - +233 27 677 7380: Taken this
10/18/22, 18:25 - +254 713 230808: Thanks!
10/18/22, 18:28 - +27 72 434 6155: Will try this one.
10/18/22, 18:29 - +254 713 230808: Thanks!
10/18/22, 19:54 - +254 713 230808: @2348036473475, something else for way forward, explore more NER models, both pretrained and those we have to build ourselves, because the one we used is capturing some weird entities like **'s** on organizations.
10/18/22, 19:56 - +254 713 230808: Also, look into how we can pick more entities, more so, those that are industry specific for example, technologies and resources mentioned in articles.
10/18/22, 19:56 - +234 810 136 1613: i pick NER5
10/18/22, 19:56 - +254 713 230808: Thank you!
10/18/22, 21:50 - +234 906 002 1302: Ready to receive artifacts for upload
10/19/22, 01:34 - +254 713 230808: @233276777380, @27724346155, @2348101361613, there are two minor errors I‚Äôd like you to help me correct. Do not rerun all cells though, just from the cells with errors going down. 

On *NER Location Notebook*, right after the cell with get_location function, kindly remove the outer brackets and add reset_index so it looks like:

df_loc2=df_loc[‚Äúlocation‚Äù].copy().reset_index()


On *NER Organization Notebook*, delete the second last cell the rerun the last two cells, i.e, the cell with copy().reset_index() and the one with to_csv commands.
10/19/22, 01:34 - +254 713 230808: Thanks in advance
10/19/22, 01:34 - +254 713 230808: Doing this

10/19/22, 06:43 - +254 713 230808: Did the laptop sleep at any point?
10/19/22, 06:43 - +233 27 677 7380: Mine took 25min
10/19/22, 06:44 - +27 72 434 6155: Have no idea, probably...
10/19/22, 06:44 - +254 713 230808: Lol. Your machine must be a beast!
10/19/22, 06:44 - +27 72 434 6155: Ey, European speed
10/19/22, 06:56 - +27 72 434 6155: After deleting the second last cell on the organization notebook, the code stopped running at 36% and gave an error code about exceeding limits...I'm re-runing it üò©. The location notebook is still running fine though.

10/19/22, 11:12 - +254 713 230808: @2348101361613 @27724346155, how far are you with yours? Silas‚Äô machine is really fast so he could pick up the one that is furthest from finish.
10/19/22, 11:17 - +234 810 136 1613: It has barely moved
10/19/22, 11:17 - +234 810 136 1613: Please run NER 5

10/19/22, 13:19 - +234 810 136 1613: Yes it is
10/19/22, 13:21 - +254 713 230808: Cool!

@233276777380, will you manage to take screenshots of QnA and Summarization before 4pm sast or should we share the white paper without the screenshots?

For the recording , Tk and I are happy if you show your streamlit app that is running locally -- just make sure the design is default
10/19/22, 15:59 - +254 713 230808: Let's try and have a recording by end of day tomorrow.
10/19/22, 15:59 - +233 27 677 7380: Okay
10/19/22, 15:59 - +233 27 677 7380: Then i would have to implement what u did in the qna
10/19/22, 15:59 - +233 27 677 7380: Sorry ner

10/19/22, 16:11 - +233 27 677 7380: Ok
10/19/22, 16:33 - +254 713 230808: Meeting is on.
10/19/22, 18:40 - +254 713 230808: @233276777380 I have to go to sleep early. Been up since 3:30 am EAT and I'm too exhausted to go on. Heres the code you can present on. If you have energy, uncomment the lines with more that one # (I tried to make them ####) and see if you can fix that section so the map picks the locations selected on the multiselector - it is currently giving *False*.

Feature to highlight when recording:
1. Code picks up all sorts of locations from addresses to city names to country names to large water masses etc
2. Locations on water masses likely connected to oil rigs.
3. Locations: radius of point indicates how many times it was mentioned in the processed articles (w/ relation to Shell)
4. Clicking on the parameter of a circle gives a pop-up of the name of the location it represents
5. Map can be zoomed in on to street lrvrl.

Organization:
1. Can choose to see mentioned organizations in descending or ascending order vis a vis number of mentions.
2. Can choose how many organizations to display using slider

Let me know if you have any questions.

10/20/22, 09:32 - +254 713 230808: Stand up is on
10/20/22, 09:42 - +254 713 230808: @Segun, further work, create clustering visualization on QnA for more insight extraction.
10/20/22, 09:47 - +254 713 230808: @2348036473475 code to process locations would ideally be transferred from StreamLit to Kedro so as to speed up the app for the end user. #WayFoward
10/20/22, 09:48 - Segun Lawal: noted
10/20/22, 09:49 - +254 713 230808: @Silas could we have a brief meeting so I can show you what to remove before you start recording?
10/20/22, 09:52 - Segun Lawal: @233276777380 These are what explore require of the presentation      Take the audience through an end-to-end demonstration of your final solution.

10/20/22, 17:46 - +234 906 002 1302: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 21:03 - +234 803 050 5798: Quick question:
Is our client Shell Oil company or the UN?
10/20/22, 21:13 - Segun Lawal: The app will best serve shell oil company
10/20/22, 21:14 - +234 803 050 5798: Thank you
10/20/22, 21:43 - +233 27 677 7380: https://www.aplitrak.com/?adid=cmFjaGVsLnNlcnJhbm8uMTEzODEuNjEyNUB6b2V0aXMuYXBsaXRyYWsuY29t
10/20/22, 21:43 - +233 27 677 7380: data science if you apply and you get it they can bring you to uk
10/21/22, 01:41 - +234 803 050 5798: PRESENTATION DECK REQUIREMENTS:
- Text summarization slide
- Text comprehension slide
- Why Streamlit? (key points)
10/21/22, 06:00 - +234 803 791 6565: I saw what you did with the slides and I like the creativity, thanks for taking our time to do that.
However I have some things to add.
For the overview page: We created three features to aid the comprehension of data i.e Text summarizer, QnA &NER on that note you can‚Äôt have text summarizer coming before text comprehension. The only things we need on that slide are project goals, project background, data mining, text comprehension and the deployment tool, just to give an overview of the whole project
10/21/22, 06:02 - +234 803 791 6565: Then for the DS part, we need to explain the tools we used, hence the kedro and docker point, we have to justify why we used pretrained models then text comprehension comes in and finally the deployment tool
10/21/22, 06:06 - +234 803 791 6565: Text Comprehension slide: we can highlight the features created i.e text summarizer, QnA and NER 
Why Streamlit: deploy ML models without the need of having the knowledge of front end languages. It‚Äôs easier to deploy using streamlit
10/21/22, 06:54 - +234 803 050 5798: Okay, thank you.  

I‚Äôll look into it and see how to fit ‚Äòem in. 

If I have any reservation, I‚Äôll pen ‚Äòem down. 

Thank you
10/21/22, 07:01 - +234 803 050 5798: Thank you. 

The ‚Äòwhy streamlit‚Äô is workable, however, the text comprehension and text summarizer slides would be very scanty with just those statements. 

We‚Äôd need more information on those processes. 

What it is
Why it
How twas configured 
When/how it is triggered 
Etc
10/21/22, 08:42 - +254 713 230808: Hi team. Kindly, let‚Äôs have a meeting today after the check in so we can finalise the matter of the artifacts, more so the presentations.
10/21/22, 09:03 - +254 713 230808: Check in is on
10/21/22, 09:03 - +233 27 677 7380: Ok

10/21/22, 09:49 - +254 713 230808: Is this what you presented on the third presentation?
10/21/22, 10:18 - +254 713 230808: @233276777380, how far with organization_5.csv?
10/21/22, 10:22 - +233 27 677 7380: done long time

10/21/22, 10:22 - +254 713 230808: Thanks
10/21/22, 10:29 - +233 27 677 7380: please what code snipet are you referring to
10/21/22, 10:30 - +234 906 002 1302: Yes, but the design was updated on the presentation
10/21/22, 10:55 - +234 906 002 1302: I am replicating the folder structure from the drive to the bucket, so when all is done I can just move all the contents as well
10/21/22, 11:59 - +254 713 230808: Presentation 3
10/21/22, 12:45 - +234 906 002 1302: Actually TK has sent a format on discord, we can use that for uniformity
10/21/22, 13:19 - +233 27 677 7380: I still dont get it
10/21/22, 13:24 - Segun Lawal: ok @233276777380 during the presentation where you showed the codes for NER, summarization and QnA this is what Lista is asking for
10/21/22, 13:24 - +233 27 677 7380: So pictures of that right
10/21/22, 13:25 - Segun Lawal: yes
10/21/22, 13:27 - +233 27 677 7380: A question

This app we built, is it for the un sdg expert
10/21/22, 13:27 - +233 27 677 7380: To use
10/21/22, 13:28 - Segun Lawal: It is for Shell Oil Company to use
10/21/22, 13:29 - Segun Lawal: to track theire alignment with SDGs and to see the perception of the general public about Shell's aSDG related ctivities
10/21/22, 13:33 - Segun Lawal: Hi Team, Please have a look at the Presentation slide we have about 2 hours left before submission
10/21/22, 13:34 - Segun Lawal: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W9d544sBqACLet0OfBVZbCwhAhuksBsmGFbEXyoTQ9w/edit#slide=id.g16f91525627_1_610
10/21/22, 13:34 - +254 713 230808: My feedback:
Slide 2: Too wordy. Could be more than one slide
Slide 3: Too busy. Could be three slides
Slide 4: Image is too squeezed. Could be better as 2 slides with image as second. 
Slide 6: Too busy. Could be three slides.
Slide 7: Could be two slides to make the image clearer. Why Streamlit could be a slide on its own and maybe come before the image.
Slide 10: Luka's section is not uniform with the rest.
10/21/22, 13:36 - +254 713 230808: Overall, the number of slides are too few considering we have up to 35 mins. There is no harm in spacing them out because atm, some slides are holding to much info and could potentially be monotonous to the audience.
10/21/22, 13:37 - +254 713 230808: Btw, what happened to the data minig graphic? It was really cool.
10/21/22, 14:18 - +233 27 677 7380: I think u should fix what u think might need fixing cos i agree with some
10/21/22, 14:41 - +234 906 002 1302: @2348030505798 @2348101361613 Waiting on your 3 page presentation
10/21/22, 14:43 - +234 810 136 1613: What 3 page press please?
10/21/22, 14:43 - +234 810 136 1613: Presentation *
10/21/22, 14:43 - +254 713 230808: I wish I could prioritise this today but it won‚Äôt be possible since I have an exam right after our meeting. I can help before the presentation though.
10/21/22, 14:43 - +234 906 002 1302: The first project we did, before the grouping
10/21/22, 14:44 - +234 906 002 1302: @2348101361613 The slides you made for the three minute presentation we did in the first two weeks
10/21/22, 14:45 - +234 810 136 1613: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 14:48 - +234 810 136 1613: Can I still meet up in an hour?
10/21/22, 14:56 - +234 906 002 1302: No problem, I can wait
10/21/22, 15:15 - Segun Lawal: I suggest we can submit what we have for the presentation just to beat the deadline as we have just 45 minutes before the deadline. Then before the final presentation we can implement all necessary changes
10/21/22, 15:15 - +234 810 136 1613: 2 mins pls

10/21/22, 15:32 - +234 906 002 1302: We still dont have the demo video thats supposed to be on the slide @233276777380
10/21/22, 15:47 - +234 906 002 1302: Because we do not have a video for the application yet, I will be uploading the new version of the presentation for now, if the bucket is not locked following the deadline, we can amend and discuss changes
10/21/22, 16:00 - +233 27 677 7380: Editing the video

10/21/22, 17:00 - +254 713 230808: No, no. Just wanted to wish you guys a lovely weekend.
10/21/22, 17:01 - +234 906 002 1302: What is this TeamA Experiment on the drive?
10/21/22, 17:01 - +254 713 230808: Which part of the drive?
10/21/22, 19:12 - +234 906 002 1302: Presentation 3
10/21/22, 22:14 - +234 906 002 1302: Presentation is about 80% done, still waiting on that video @233276777380
10/21/22, 22:47 - +233 27 677 7380: Will u need the video tonight
10/21/22, 23:03 - +234 906 002 1302: No not necessarily,
10/22/22, 01:22 - +234 906 002 1302: Presentation complete, I fused elements from both versions
10/22/22, 12:34 - +254 713 230808: One thing I can say I admire about our DE team mates is their grit and will to go beyond the call of duty. üòçüòçüòç
10/22/22, 12:39 - Segun Lawal: I second. They can go above and beyond
10/22/22, 16:36 - +254 713 230808: @233276777380 Do you need any help with the prerecording?
10/22/22, 16:37 - +233 27 677 7380: Done now
10/22/22, 16:37 - +234 906 002 1302: Especially that Byron guy
10/22/22, 16:37 - +234 810 136 1613: Lol
10/22/22, 16:38 - +254 713 230808: Share the link so Daniel can upload a full presentation please.
10/22/22, 16:39 - +254 713 230808: That tall serious-faced guy! Hahahaha.
10/22/22, 16:39 - +233 27 677 7380: Ayt
10/22/22, 16:40 - +254 713 230808: On the real though, it‚Äôs all of you: @2348030505798, @2349060021302 and @34677511200. You were all inspirational imo
10/22/22, 17:35 - +234 906 002 1302: How do you know he is tall, Sista Lista
10/22/22, 17:36 - +234 906 002 1302: @233276777380 Please you cab just put it on the slide 15 with the link, I cant upload until that is done
10/22/22, 17:38 - +234 906 002 1302: Is it name entity recognition or named entity recognition?
10/22/22, 17:58 - Segun Lawal: Well, when Silas was traveling, Byron said he would have gone with him but his height wouldn't let him fit into the luggage. He is over 6 feet tall
10/22/22, 18:09 - +254 713 230808: Named entity
10/22/22, 21:21 - +233 27 677 7380: https://youtu.be/oBHltWxWxxo

10/24/22, 08:32 - +254 713 230808: Good morning. Zintles mini conference is on
10/24/22, 08:32 - +254 713 230808: It‚Äôs in presentations
10/24/22, 08:32 - +254 713 230808: It‚Äôs on*
10/24/22, 08:42 - +234 906 002 1302: Wait a minute
10/24/22, 08:43 - +234 906 002 1302: Are we supposed to present anything todayüò®
10/24/22, 08:44 - +27 72 434 6155: No, our time slot is on Wednesday.
10/24/22, 08:45 - +234 906 002 1302: Whew
10/24/22, 08:45 - +234 906 002 1302: üòÇ
10/24/22, 08:46 - +234 906 002 1302: Good morning team A this is your private commentary on all presentations, time to scope the competition
10/24/22, 08:46 - +254 713 230808: Let the games begin!
10/24/22, 08:46 - +27 72 434 6155: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10/24/22, 08:47 - +254 713 230808: Btw, I sent our slides to TK and Luka for feedback.
10/24/22, 08:49 - +234 906 002 1302: Okay, thanks for that. I was waiting to send it today
10/24/22, 08:50 - +254 713 230808: Wow. These guys are still using "Meet the Team" slide.
10/24/22, 08:51 - +234 906 002 1302: This current presentation is mid, I'm sorry to say but no excitement, in their voices or slides
10/24/22, 08:51 - +234 906 002 1302: Guys please o, relax, tell small jokes, be fluid else people will sleep
10/24/22, 08:51 - +254 713 230808: IKR. Let's learn from them and use more exciting voices lol.
10/24/22, 08:56 - +254 713 230808: Is it just me or does this Emmanuel guy look like Byron?
10/24/22, 08:56 - +234 906 002 1302: Imposter
10/24/22, 08:56 - +254 713 230808: Byron has been two-timing us lol
10/24/22, 08:57 - +234 906 002 1302: That reminds me, we need to do some form of cost analysis for our presentation, we may not necessarily have a slide, but it should at least be mentioned
10/24/22, 08:58 - +254 713 230808: What do you mean by cost analysis?
10/24/22, 08:59 - +234 906 002 1302: What it would cost to build and maintain our pipeline, even if it's all open sourced it should be mentioned, cos if we are making this presentation to clients, realistically this is something that comes up
10/24/22, 08:59 - +254 713 230808: Aaaahhh! You are very right!
10/24/22, 09:00 - +254 713 230808: Interesting.
10/24/22, 09:06 - +254 713 230808: We should incorporate this QR code idea lol. 

The only time I've ever used it it backfired
10/24/22, 09:07 - +234 906 002 1302: It didn't work üò≠ I just tried it, their app is buggy
10/24/22, 09:07 - +234 906 002 1302: It just backfired for them
10/24/22, 09:08 - +254 713 230808: Yeah :(
10/24/22, 09:08 - +254 713 230808: I know the feeling o!
10/24/22, 09:14 - +254 713 230808: I envy that these guys are done üòí
10/24/22, 09:14 - +234 810 136 1613: Lol, our will come and pass too
10/24/22, 09:15 - +234 810 136 1613: Ours*
10/24/22, 09:17 - +234 906 002 1302: Oookay, this new team is looking intimidating
10/24/22, 09:19 - +254 713 230808: Luka's feedback üëÜüèø. He will discuss his comments more during the stand up.

10/24/22, 09:34 - +254 713 230808: Daniel your presence is needed please
10/24/22, 09:35 - +254 713 230808: Or Byron
10/24/22, 10:20 - +233 27 677 7380: guys as a form of fail safe i am suggesting that all those presenting should type what they want to say and drop it in the group just incase your internet fails you on that day so that some one else can follow your script and deliver 

what do you guys think
10/24/22, 10:21 - +254 713 230808: Support it.
10/24/22, 10:21 - +234 810 136 1613: Good idea
10/24/22, 10:21 - +234 906 002 1302: Yes, let's plan for backup presenters for each section
10/24/22, 10:21 - +233 27 677 7380: yes
10/24/22, 10:23 - +234 906 002 1302: @254713230808 when are you going to have time to make changes to the slides? Also feel free to go crazy with it
10/24/22, 10:24 - +254 713 230808: Currently working on images to make it have a uniform feel.
10/24/22, 10:26 - Segun Lawal: Great idea
10/24/22, 10:29 - +233 27 677 7380: ok so if all are in favor then we would be expecting the script in the group by the end of the day(12:00 GMT) from
@2348037916565 
@2349060021302 
@2348036473475
10/24/22, 10:54 - Segun Lawal: "Further Development Presentation Script" is on the teams google drive
10/24/22, 10:56 - +254 713 230808: Can you arrange it on the note section of the relevant slides please?
10/24/22, 10:57 - Segun Lawal: Alright
10/24/22, 10:57 - +254 713 230808: Thank you!
10/24/22, 11:01 - Segun Lawal: Done!
10/24/22, 11:11 - +254 713 230808: Thanks!
10/24/22, 13:50 - +234 906 002 1302: I am not part of the group
10/24/22, 14:03 - +233 27 677 7380: Oh ok
10/25/22, 13:45 - +254 713 230808: @2348036473475 where the link at?
10/25/22, 13:46 - Segun Lawal: Oh sorry
10/25/22, 13:46 - Segun Lawal: Give me a minute
10/25/22, 13:47 - Segun Lawal: https://meet.google.com/dii-cvdf-qoy

10/26/22, 07:01 - +254 713 230808: Good morning.

I have made the changes requested by TK apart from the ones that are on DE: 

*1. You spoke alot on the first slide of data mining, it almost felt like you needed another slide to put those thought down so people can see and visualise what you are saying*

*2. Further Development - Why just ECR, it should be a combination of ECR and ECS. You can even juxtapose it with the current EC2 deployment*

@2349060021302 , @2348030505798 if it is possible, kindly look into these. For the second one, adjustments will have to be made on the speaker notes as well.
10/26/22, 07:21 - +254 713 230808: I just read through your script and I don't see the need to change 1... imo
10/26/22, 08:06 - +234 810 136 1613: Good morning y‚Äôall

10/26/22, 09:52 - +234 906 002 1302: Minions as visualization, interesting
10/26/22, 09:52 - +254 713 230808: Banane!

10/26/22, 10:03 - +254 713 230808: Nnamdi‚Äôs hand is already up ü§¶
10/26/22, 10:04 - +234 906 002 1302: It's like he has already done his presentation that's why he is not scared
10/26/22, 10:04 - +234 906 002 1302: If not, I'd have joined his own presentation
10/26/22, 10:07 - +254 713 230808: He presented yesterday lol
10/26/22, 10:08 - +254 713 230808: Guy has some serious questions though
10/26/22, 10:09 - +233 27 677 7380: But it not cool

10/26/22, 10:11 - +254 713 230808: Like good friends! He even introduced me to Clara lmao

10/26/22, 10:14 - +234 906 002 1302: Like, Paul for no talk
10/26/22, 10:14 - +234 906 002 1302: Time would have just run out
10/26/22, 10:14 - +234 810 136 1613: Nnamdi is brutal, the guy‚Äôs head dey hot

10/26/22, 10:14 - +234 906 002 1302: He should go and drink cold water jare
10/26/22, 10:16 - +234 803 050 5798: If the guy was in the Explore team, he would have told someone else like him ‚ÄúErm, that question is very unnecessary here‚Äù
10/26/22, 10:29 - +234 906 002 1302: I need to record this part, it's going to be great for when I have insomnia
10/26/22, 10:30 - +234 906 002 1302: At least team B had minions üòè
